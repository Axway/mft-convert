---<span id="RECOV___General_Network_Error_Recovery_Codes"></span>RECOV corresponds to the code common to all network access methods,
providing a general indication about the cause of the error.

One value can correspond to two causes, depending on whether the source
of the error is at the local or remote end; "L" is indicated
in case of ambiguity:

- L=1:
    local
- L=0:
    remote
