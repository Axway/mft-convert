DIAGC are a readable source of additional information concerning a transfer intended to supplement DIAGI and DIAGP, which can be useful in troubleshooting instances. The DIAGC may display as part of a log message or, depending on the issue, it may also display in the catalog, though it does not systematically display for all transfer errors.

****Example****

In this example, there was an SFTP transfer with an authentication problem (incorrect password). Checking the DIAGC provides connection details.

In the catalog (content=brief) :
