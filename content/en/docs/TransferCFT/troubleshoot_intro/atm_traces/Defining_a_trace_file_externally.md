## Command overview

The following tables are an example of the commands and parameters to
be used for the various trace processes.

### Define trace files

| Trace file definition | Command &lt;/th&gt;  | Parameter &lt;/th&gt;  | Description &lt;/th&gt;  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before starting<br /> Transfer CFT  | CFTPARM  | TRACE=identifier  | CFTTRACE command identifier  |

## Using the STARTTRC command

This command, which is associated with a unique identifier, performs
the following tasks:

- Defines and describes
    the conditions for starting and selecting traced data
- Associates a file
    identifier, already defined by the SETTRC command, with this trace which
    designated the file in which the traces will be stored

### Syntax

`STARTTRC ID = identifier,TID =  identifier`

### Parameters

`ID = identifier`

Identifier which makes the trace vector defined by this parameter set
uniquely identifiable.

This parameter is a character string, maximum length 8.

**`[FTRACE = {0   &#124; 0..15}]`**

**`[MTRACE = {0   &#124; 0..31}]`**

**`[PTRACE = {0   &#124; 0..31}]`**

`TID =  identifier`

Identifier of the **SETTRC** or **CFTTRACE** command which defines
the collection’s output trace file.

This identifier should exist, in that it should have been initialized
by a **SETTRC** or **CFTTRACE** command**.**

This parameter is a character string, maximum length 8.

`[XTRACE = {0 &#124;   0..7}]`

Checks the level 1 traces for Transfer CFT "EXIT" type operations.

This parameter is only relevant if the parameter **START = CFT**.

The chosen value is a mask (logical OR) combination of the desired values.
These values are:

- 1: Trace of the
    request field passed by Transfer CFT to the exit executive
- 2: Trace of the
    user work field
- 4: Trace of the
    data field

<span id="Using_the_stop_trace_command"></span><span id="About_the_STOPTRC_command"></span>

## Using the STOPTRC command

This command defines and describes the conditions for stopping a trace.
The trace to be stopped is indicated by the identifier previously created
by the **STARTTRC** command.

### Syntax

`STOPTRC  ID =   identifier`

### Parameters

`ID = identifier`

Identifier which uniquely identifies the trace vector defined by this
set of parameters.

This parameter is a character string, maximum length: 8.

## Collect a trace

The following example shows how to retrieve a protocol trace. You can use the same steps to perform other types of traces.

1. Start {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName >}}.

1. Use the command utility CFTTRACE to set and start the following trace, for example:

    CFTTRACE SETTRC ID=TRC0,TRCFNAM=&lt;trc_collect_file_name>,mode=create

    CFTTRACE STARTTRC ID=T1,TID=TRC0,PTRACE=28

1. Check that the `CFTATMC `process is started.

1. Execute the transfer to trace.

## Extract a trace

To extract information, use the CFTTRACE utility to stop and extract the trace. For example:

CFTTRACE STOPTRC ID=t1

CFTTRACE SETTRC ID=TRC0, MODE=CLOSE

CFTTRACE EXTRACT IFNAME=&lt;trc_collect_file_name>, OFNAME=&lt;trc_txt_file_name>, CONTENT=FULL, PRESENT=intall

<span id="About_the_TRCFILE_command"></span>

## TRCFILE command details

Trace files can be created and pre- formatted in their order of occurrence
or externally with a utility, in particular for environments that cannot
support such operations. The utility is integrated in CFTTRACE, with the
command **TRCFILE** **TYPE = TRACE.**

Use this command to create or destroy a trace file, or to reinitialize
it with empty useable content.

### Syntax

`TRCFILE  TYPE = TRACE, [MODE = {CREATE &#124; REPLACE &#124; DELETE},] TRCFNAM = filename, TRCFTYP = {STANDARD &#124; CIRCULAR}, `

`TRCFTYP = STANDARD [TRCLREC = {1024 &#124; n}] `

`TRCFTYP = CIRCULAR TRCNREC = n,TRCLREC = {0 &#124; 1024 &#124; n}`

### Parameters

`[MODE = {CREATE   &#124; REPLACE &#124; DELETE},]`

Type of operation to be carried out on the file:

- CREATE: Create
    and initialize a trace file that does not yet exist.  
    If the file already exists, this operation is refused
- REPLACE: Reinitialize
    an existing trace file.  
    If the file does not already exist, it is created
- DELETE: Delete
    a trace file

`TRCFNAM = filename`

Name of the trace file.

`TRCFTYP = {STANDARD   &#124; CIRCULAR}`

Type of trace file for which an operation is requested:

- STANDARD: Sequential
    file (fixed record size)
- CIRCULAR: Direct
    file (fixed record size)

`[TRCLREC = {0   &#124; 1024 &#124; n}]`

Size of records contained in the trace file.

This parameter is:

- Mandatory when
    TRCFTYP = CIRCULAR, with a default value of 0
- Optional when TRCFTYP
    = STANDARD with a default value of 1024

`[TRCNREC = n]`

Number of useable records contained in the direct file.

This parameter is:

- Mandatory when
    **TRCFTYP = CIRCULAR**
- Not applicable
    when **TRCFTYP = STANDARD**

`TYPE = TRACE`

Operation on a trace file.

## SETTRC command details

The SETTRC command:

- Defines and describes
    a trace file, which can be available to store captured information
- Associates an identifier
    with this file and description, which allows it to be identified uniquely,
    if the user wishes to distribute several trace types into several different
    files

### Syntax

`SETTRC  ID = identifier,TRCFNAM = {" " &#124; filename},[TRCFTYP = {STANDARD &#124; CIRCULAR},[MODE = {CREATE &#124; REPLACE &#124; CLOSE},] `

`TRCFTYP = STANDARD [TRCLREC = {0 &#124; n}]`

`TRCFTYP = CIRCULAR TRCLREC = {0 &#124; n},TRCNREC  = n`

### Parameters

`[ID = identifier]`

Character string, maximum length: 8; uniquely identifies the trace file
descriptor defined by this set of parameters.

`[MODE = {CREATE   &#124; REPLACE &#124; CLOSE}]`

Operation to be performed on the ‘‘trace file" entry designated
by the ID parameter:

- CREATE: Create
    an entry, and possibly the file
- REPLACE: Replace
    the file with another one for the same entry
- CLOSE: Delete an
    entry, the file will then be closed

Where **MODE = CLOSE**, only the **ID** parameter is useful.

`TRCFNAM = {"   " &#124; filename}`

Name of trace file to be fed by traces.

Character string maximum length: 64 characters.

`[TRCFTYP = {STANDARD   &#124; CIRCULAR}]`

Trace file type:

- STANDARD: Sequential
    file written in "extend".  
    The new records are written after the old ones
- CIRCULAR: Direct
    access file, with a set number of fixed- length records.  
    This file is accessed through a circular up- date, the new records overwriting
    the old ones

`[TRCLREC = {0   &#124; n}]`

Length of trace file’s physical records.

This parameter is:

- Mandatory if TRCFTYP
    = CIRCULAR  
    Concatenation and segmentation algorithms make it possible to manage
    the real - essentially variable - size of data to be written to this file
- Optional if TRCFTYP
    = STANDARD (sequential file, with fixed- size records)

`[TRCNREC = n]`

Number of trace file records.

This parameter is:

- Mandatory if TRCFTYP
    = CIRCULAR
- Not applicable
    if TRCFTYP = STANDARD
