--- Adding an application is a prerequisite to defining a flow and being able to exchange files.

1. Click Applications on the top toolbar to open the Application List page.
1. Click Add application.
1. At a minimum:
    - Enter a unique name for the application.  
    - Specify the system that hosts the application, a host name or an IP address.
    - Enter the name of the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}}.
    - If {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}} is installed on the same host as the application,Central Governance will detect the matching Transfer CFT instance. You can change this value if you want to associate this application with a different {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}}.
1. Click Save application to add it.

For these exercises repeat the steps and create 3 applications, MainOffice, Store_66, and Store_89.
