---If error messages display when loading the profile, for example "CFTDIRDATÂ parameter not set", the error may be due to a new file in the $CFTDIRRUNTIME/profile.d directory. An example of this is `cft-autocomplete.bash_completion`, which was introduced in {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName  >}} 3.3.0.

To fix this issue, you can run the following command :

```
cftruntime -p $CFTDIRINSTALL $CFTDIRRUNTIME
```

This command saves the current profile and creates a new one. You can compare the previous profile file with the new one, and keep the file you require.
