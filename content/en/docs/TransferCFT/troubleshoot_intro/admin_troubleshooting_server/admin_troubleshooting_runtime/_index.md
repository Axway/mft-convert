Runtime issues can include the following for the server, Copilot, CFTUTIL and other system services:

- Abend
- Performance
- Start disk space, multi-node issues, restart
- Unexpected shut down, such as when the catalog is full
- System freezes or infinite looping
- Service pack issues (applying or removing), also for migrating issues, updates

## Initial checks and actions

### Disk check

- No space left on the device
    -   Free space
    -   Check Sentinel connectivity an{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}}d verify the size of the runtime/data/trkapi.buf file, which may be voluminous
- Check for problematic file transfers and output, and clean
- Check to see if traces are set, which may lead to multiple large files in the "run" directory
- Check to see if you have enabled dynamic catalog resizing

### Catalog check

When the catalog is full stops and you cannot restart it without a correction action to reduce the size of the catalog. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the disk is full.

- See the [Catalog housekeeping](../../../admin_intro/admin_monitoring_intro/housekeeping_catalog) section
- Backup your catalog and export the existing catalog

### Export the full catalog

Create a new catalog file configured for a greater number of records, and re-import the original catalog file.

Use the command: cftmi

1. Export the full catalog as shown in the following example.
1. Check that the exported file is not empty.
1. Create new catalog:
1. Import the exported catalog file into the new catalog.
1. Move (rename) depending on your operating system:

### Network checks

These corrective measures are often system dependent.

- Perform basic tests such as pinging the address, and telnet (to check the port)

### Check additional products

- Check if another product is consuming all of the CPU/memory
- Check {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM >}} interoperability, such as the {{< TransferCFT/PrimarySentinel >}}Â database
- Scripts or end-of-transfer procedures may indirectly
