--- This topic lists the CFTWxx and CFTXxx messages and provides the type, a description, consequence, and corrective actions when applicable.

**Message format**

Earlier versions of Transfer CFT used a different message format than version 3.1.3 and higher. This document displays both formats when applicable and available, otherwise only the v23 is used. Using the CFTLOG Format = V24 setting, the log displays as shown:

`CFTXXX: fixed text message <variables>`

**Example**

CFTLOG FORMAT=[V23,V24]

For V23: `CFTT57I PART=&part IDF=&idf IDT=&idt &str transfer started`

For V24: `CFTT57I &str transfer started   <IDTU=&idtu PART=&part IDF=&idf IDT=&idt>`
