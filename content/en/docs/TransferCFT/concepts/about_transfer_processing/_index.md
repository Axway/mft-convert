}This section describes the phases for which you can define script execution to perform certain processing procedures. These procedures are described according to the phase, or timing in the transfer process, when they should occur. See the following sections for phase-specific details.

- [Preprocessing phase](../phase_and_phasestep/preprocessing)
- [Post processing phase](../phase_and_phasestep/post_process_phase)
- [Acknowledgement phase](../phase_and_phasestep/ack_phase)
- [Done phase](../phase_and_phasestep/done_phase)

For more information on transfer processing syntax, see [Processing commands.](proc_commands)
