---The SEND command initiates a send transfer. You can use it to send files, messages, or replies (acknowledgments). You can define the characteristics in the SEND command itself, or in a Central {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesGovernance  >}} flow definition in a template command. Additionally you can use the SEND command for a single partner or a list of partners.

## Sending messages

The SEND TYPE = MESSAGE command is used to send a message to the designated
partner. You can, as with files, define local parameters and execution control
parameters such as scheduling.

## Sending replies

When sending a reply it is similar to sending a message, but there are two types of replies - acknowledgments and negative acknowledgement. This type of SEND is always linked to a transfer.
