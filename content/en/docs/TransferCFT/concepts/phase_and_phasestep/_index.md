{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} provides a complete processing workflow that includes file preprocessing, transfer processing, post processing script execution and acknowledgement. As  of {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 3.0 processing features have evolved, replacing the former ****state**** with the Phase/Phase step pair, to improve the visibility of a flow. The processing phase shows where you are in your transfer. Within each phase there is a phase step, which can be either a process or a step.

This topic presents processing ****concepts****, step overviews in the following sections:

- [Types of processing phases](#Types)
- [Phasesteps in each phase](#Types2)
- [About backward compatibility](#About)
- [Example usage](#Example)

Types of processing phases
--------------------------

The term ****phase**** refers to the highest level in the transfer flow cycle:

- (A) Pre-processing: All pre-transfer script execution occurs here
- (T) Transferring: All transfer execution occurs in this phase
- (Y) Post-processing: All post-transfer script execution occurs here
- (Z) Acknowledgement: Acknowledgement reception/send steps and ack script execution occur here
- (X) Done: End condition when all of the previous phases are completed

Phasesteps in each phase
------------------------

The ****phasestep**** refers to the details that can occur during any given phase:

- (D) At disposal: The processing of the Phase is ready to be executed; it is ready to go.
- (H) Hold: The processing of the Phase is on hold and waiting for an action to be executed.
- (C) Processing/Current: The Phase processing is being executed.
- (K) Keep: The Phase processing is stopped.
- (X) Done: This phase step only exists for the Done phase, once all previous phases are complete.
- (E) Exit EOT: This phase step only exists for the Post-processing phase, to signal an [end-of-transfer exit](../../app_integration_intro/managing_exits/about_the_end_of_transfer_type_exit).

About backward compatibility
----------------------------

For continued compatibility and to help in transitioning, clients may still use the former states, which were not modified. Alternately, they can use the adapted states that reflect the phase and phase step. See [Compatibility](processing_compatability).

Example usage
-------------

This guide provides the following usage example for implementation: [Adding a zip script.](../about_transfer_processing/preprocess_use_case2)
