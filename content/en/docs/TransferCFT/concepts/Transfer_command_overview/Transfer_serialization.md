---## Requester mode

If the number of outgoing connections ([CNXOUT](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/cnxout))
is 1 for a partner, then all transfers with the same level of priority
are activated in order of their submitted request.

This function is referred to as transfer serialization. However, a failed
transfer that has an ****H**** or ****K**** state does not block activation of
subsequent requests for this same partner.

Please see [Transfer serialization](../../../app_integration_intro/transfer_serialization) for a detailed explanation.
