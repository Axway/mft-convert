--- The transfer concept topics introduce the various {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} transfer
processes. For general transfer principles, refer to the introductory
overview section.

The transfer commands are
divided in categories depending on their function.

## Entering a command

There are multiple interfaces that you can use to enter Transfer CFT commands, such as the Transfer CFT command utility CFTUTIL or client user interface.

You can enter a command using CFTUTIL in a command window from the Transfer CFT runtime directory. For example in a Windows environment:

```
C:\\Axwaycft313sp1\\Transfer_CFT\\runtime> profile
C:\\Axwaycft313sp1\\Transfer_CFT\\runtime> CFTUTIL  
1:[CFU]
```

## Entering parameters

There are two ways to supply parameters for a command:

- You can define all information for a command, both mandatory and optional parameters

<!- - - - >

- You can rely on default values or template values that are common for a given command

## Using basic transfer associated commands

The commands associated with the transfers are listed in the table below.

| Type | Command | Description |
| - - - | - - - | - - - |
| Transfers  | [SEND]()  | Send files, messages, or replies (acknowledgments)  |
| - " - | [RECV]()  | Receive files  |
| Actions on transfers  | [DELETE](../../admin_intro/admin_commands_intro/delete_command) | Delete catalog entries  |
| - " - | [HALT](../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil/managing_transfer_states/halt_command) | Stop transfers  |
| - " - | [KEEP](../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil/managing_transfer_states/keep_command) | Suspend transfers  |
| - " - | [START](../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil/managing_transfer_states/start_command) | Restart transfers  |
| - " - | [SUBMIT](../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil/managing_transfer_states/submit_command) | Submit an end- of- transfer procedure |
| - " - | [END](../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil/managing_transfer_states/end_command) | Declare that flow is finished |

For each command, the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} command interface performs the following
actions:

- Checks the syntax
    of the command
- Puts the command
    in the Transfer CFT communication medium
