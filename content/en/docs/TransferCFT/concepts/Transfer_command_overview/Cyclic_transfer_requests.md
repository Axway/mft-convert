--- A cyclic transfer
request is a periodic, repeated transfer request. The period, the time
between 2 transfer activation cycles, is defined by the CYCLE and TCYCLE parameters.

- CYCLE: Numeric value for TCYCLE.
- TCYCLE: The type of period, expressed in minutes (MIN), days (DAY), or months (MONTH).

## Defining the cycle time frame

The time frame for a cyclic transfer request is defined by the MINDATE/MINTIME
and MAXDATE/MAXTIME parameters, and corresponds to the global time during
which the transfers are periodically repeated.

The time slot for activating each basic transfer is defined by the MINDATE/MINTIME
and CYCDATE/CYCTIME parameters, where:

- CYCDATE: End date for activating
    a transfer in a cycle, where the value is recalculated for each new cycle.
- CYCTIME: End time for activating a transfer in a cycle, where the value is recalculated for each new cycle.

> **Note**
>
> The CYCDATE/CYCTIME is equivalent to the MAXDATE/MAXTIME for a request. If the request is not executed before the date/time, then the request is not executed (times out).

The start time/date and cycle duration
values are expressed in the following equation:

`CYCLE * TCYCLE >= (CYCDATE,CYCTIME) - (MINDATE,MINTIME)`

**Example**

The example command creates a cyclic transfer request as shown below:

```
SEND PART=PARIS, MINDATE=20150703, MINTIME=1000, MAXDATE=20151231, MAXTIME=1000, CYCLE=7, TCYCLE=DAY, CYCDATE=20150705, CYCTIME=1000
```

- The request start date and time is July 3, 2015 at 10:00 (MINDATE/MINTIME).
- A period of inactivity begins on July 5, 2015 at 10:00 (CYCDATE/CYCTIME).
    - A child transfer of the cyclic request who's execution begins during the period of activity will complete, even if that time extends into time timeout.
    - Any child transfer of the generic request that is not executed before the timeout is lost.
- The cycle duration is 7 days (CYCLE/TCYCLE), so activity restarts on July 10, 2015.
- This pattern repeats itself until the defined end date and time (MAXDATE/MAXTIME).

A cyclic transfer request results in the creation of a generic virtual
transfer entry for the actual transfers. This generic entry is maintained in the
transfer catalog and gives rise, for each new cycle, to a real transfer. The generic entry is purged at the end of the last
cycle, when MAXDATE is exceeded.

A generic entry is characterized by
one of the values indicated in the table below, for the DIAGP field, at
the time the catalog is queried (LISTCAT CONTENT=BRIEF).

******Generic entry values******

| Diagp value  | Cycle  |
| --- | --- |
| MIN CYC  | Cycle expressed in minutes  |
| DAY CYC  | Cycle expressed in days  |
| MON CYC  | Cycle expressed in months  |

request.
