This topic provides information on common mistakes when setting up user rights, fixes, and how to get more information when an error occurs.

## User rights recommendations

The following best practices may help you avoid or correct user rights issues. Deviating from these recommendation may lead to unexpected user rights, or errors in the log.

- Respect the appropriate case (upper/lower) for user names and passwords.
- The am.type is set by default to enable {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM >}}. Modifying this value effects user rights and access from {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName >}}.
- Changing the domain may affect your ability to log in on the Transfer CFT client.
- If you modify the createprocessasuser parameter setting, you must restart Copilot for the parameter change to be taken into account.
- The am.passport.superuser can perform any superuser activity. From {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName >}} there is no check on the superuser; this user has all access regardless of the {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName >}} roles and privileges.
- When USERCTRL is set to YES and if the [USERID](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/userid) parameter is not set, then the file transfer owner (when receiving) or file reader (when sending) is the user that started {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName >}}.

## Troubleshooting user rights issues

### Access {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} logs in {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}}

In the {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} interface, select **Products**. Select your {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} in the **Product List**, and in the right pane click **Logs**.

### Messages and logs in Transfer CFT

If there is no information available in the {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} logs for the Transfer CFT, next check the following:

- {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName >}} logs
- {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName >}} trace files located in the <span class="code">`<installation directory>Transfer_CFT\runtime\run`</span>

### Check user definitions in {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}}

In {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} roles and privileges grant or limit user permissions to perform actions, and define the user interface areas that they can access. See the {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesDocTypeUser  >}} for detailed descriptions of user roles and privileges.

## Issues

**From** **{{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} I cannot perform {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} actions that I previously could perform**

Check that the local {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} superuser is correctly defined. This is a requirement for {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} to correctly manage your {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}}. The value displayed in {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} should match the value that displays for <span class="code">`CFTUTIL listuconf value=am.passport.superuser`</span>.

**I am a user with **{{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}}** rights to create flows, but** **I cannot create a flow**

Check the superuser file rights for the local {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}}s runtime environment (all runtime directory contents).

**I cannot connect to the Transfer CFT Copilot server even though I am the superuser defined in the UCONF file**

While the superuser has all privileges and is granted to all possible actions on a resource, when you log on the Transfer CFT Copilot server this triggers a credential check. Therefore, the superuser user must be defined in {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}}.

**Transfer CFT client hangs**

The Transfer CFT client has been launched at least one time from the root/system admin userid, making the root/system admin the owner of the persistent cache (in data directory). See [am.passport.persistency.fname](../../../admin_intro/uconf/uconf_directory).

Therefore, even when the Transfer CFT client is launched with the Transfer CFT user (a user with appropriate privileges) this user cannot update the persistent cache and causes {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} to query {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesCentralGovernanceName  >}} (PassPort AM) each time it needs to try to update the local cache.

To fix the issue, delete the persistent cache files (CFTAM and CFTAM.idx) and restart the Transfer CFT Copilot server.
