---## Post manual migration or auto import

If you performed an install and auto import or a manual migration, you must manually import compiled objects and exec scripts from the old configuration. There are no {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} commands to import these compiled objects and exec scripts, and they are not included in the auto import process.

> **Note**
>
> After completing an upgrade or a migration procedure, you must update to the most recent SP.

### Compiled objects:Â APIs and Exits

To manually migrate your API and exit binary files after migrating, copy your program's source code to the new Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion  >}} runtime directory and compile them.

1. Copy the API source code to &lt;new_Transfer CFT_{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion >}}_installation_dir>/runtime/src/capi and compile.

1. Copy the Exit source code to &lt;new_Transfer CFT_{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion >}}_installation_dir>/runtime/src/exit and compile.

### Exec scripts

Copy the exec scripts to &lt;new_Transfer CFT_{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion  >}}_installation_dir>/runtime/exe. It is important that you update any paths that you were using in the exec scripts to reflect the new installation directory.

## Post-manual migration only

### Migrating UCONF parameters from a previous Transfer CFT version

You must manually migrate UCONF parameters for versions prior to {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 2.5.1. The UCONF configuration
replaces the following configuration files:

- Sentinel configuration
    file (trkapi.cfg, trkapi.conf, and so on...)  
    The parameters in the Sentinel file are integrated
    in UCONF as sentinel.FORMER-PARAMETER-NAME. For example, TRKTNAME becomes
    sentinel.TRKTNAME.
- Copilot ini file
    (copconf.ini)  
    This file no longer exists. All former Copilot parameters are named `copilot.SECTION.PARAMETER-NAME` in the UCONF interface. For example, the parameter ServerPort, located in the general section, is now `copilot.general.serverport`.
- The profile file, formerly ENV_CFT or cft.ini, now
    uses UCONF to set the environment variables.

## Post upgrade

If you performed an upgrade, you need only recompile your APIs and Exits.
