## Installation overview

This table presents a high-level overview of the installation process. By default, the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} installation uses a delivered configuration file called `initialize.properties` that provides a series of default values to simplify installation. It is important that you understand the difference between customizing this file before or after running the installer prior to starting the process.


|   | Step  | Details  | More info  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | Complete prerequisites  | Check and fulfill prerequisites such as obtaining a key or system-specific prerequisites.  | [![](/Images/TransferCFT/severityInformation_alt.gif)](prereqs_overview)  |
| 2  | Download and unzip  | Download the installation package from the support site and unzip.  |   |
| 3  | Customize the properties file  | Some installation parameters are mandatory to run Transfer CFT.<br/> You can customize the <code>initialize.properties</code> file before the install, use your own file, or use the unmodified default file, but you cannot start Transfer CFT until the mandatory values are set. |   |
| 4  | Start the installation  | Select the installation mode and run using either the default configuration file or your customized file.  | [![](/Images/TransferCFT/severityInformation_alt.gif)](install_transfer_cft_1)  |
| *  | Optional customization  | If you used the default configuration file, you must customize the Transfer CFT settings before starting the product.  |   |


### Installation restrictions

Transfer CFT supports the use of UNC paths for a `runtime `directory, but you cannot create the Transfer CFT `installdir `in a UNC folder.

### Installation restrictions for multi-node

The following multi-node restrictions apply:

* Bandwidth control is calculated by node.
* Accounting statistics are generated by node.
* Nodes are not automatically re-balanced when a host is recovered after a failure.
* Duplicate file detection is not supported.
* When using COMS, the SEND/RECV commands does not support STATE=HOLD with WSTATE.
* You cannot have more than one defined CFTCOM TYPE=FILE object.

When using {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} with {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} multi node, you cannot manage {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} updates. You are required to manually update the nodes.

### Install functions

You can perform the following installation functions:

* Install
* Upgrade
* Update
* Uninstall

### Installation configuration file

The {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} installation is based on a delivered configuration file called `initialize.properties` that provides a series of default values to simplify installation. You can make a copy of this file and customize it prior to running the installation procedure as described in [Customize the initialize.properties file](properties_file_win).

### Installation modes

The following installation modes use the delivered initialize.properties file as the default configuration file. In graphical mode you can install, but not operate, {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} without customizing certain mandatory values in this file. To run silent mode, you must at least define an installation directory prior to running the unattended installation.

****Graphical mode****

`Transfer_CFT_3.6_Install_win-x86-64_BNXXXXXXXX.exe`

****Silent****

` start /W Transfer_CFT_3.6_Install_win-x86-64_BNXXXXXXXX.exe --mode unattended --conf-file configuration.template`

> **Note**
>
> For all installation types, including silent installations, you must accept the installation General Terms and Conditions.

### Create or modify the runtime

You can use the following command to repair the runtime if there was an issue during the installation, or to update values that you have modified in the `initialize.properties` file. From the &lt;installation_directory>, run the following:

`<installation directory> initialize filename`

You cannot configure the Windows services using the initialize.exe command. Please see [Install services in command line](../install_services_command_line) to manually configure the Windows services.

### How to use symbolic links with a Transfer CFT installation

To install Transfer CFT using symbolic links, you must use the `option '--mode unattended'` silent mode and the `initialize.properties` configuration file to assign parameters. Do not declare parameters in the command line.

#### Install using symbolic link example

This example is based on an extraction from the initialize.properties file.

* runtimedir: `F:\share1\CFT39_GPFS` (refers to the shared disk for a multi-node/multi-host installation)
* installdir: `F:\CFT39_GPFS_LINK` (refers to the symbolic link)

Before installing with symbolic links, perform the following steps on each host:

1. Configure `initialize.properties` file.

1. Create the actual directory, called `REAL `in this example:

    `S:\>mkdir F:\CFT39_GPFS_REAL`

1. Create the symbolic link, called `LINK `in this example:

    `S:\>mklink /j F:\CFT39_GPFS_REAL F:\CFT39_GPFS_LINK `

> **Note**
>
> If an installation that uses symbolic links fails: correct the silent file, delete the Transfer CFT home installation directory to which the symbolic link points, and retry the installation.

#### Using symbolic links on Windows platforms

If you use symbolic links during installation, the link path must use a slash delimiter as shown in the following example:

* Correct:`  S:\>mklink /j F:\CFT36m5 F:\CFT36_BN12786077_5`
* Incorrect:` S:\>mklink /j F:CFT36m5 F:CFT36_BN12786077_5`

### Run as administrator

The user who installs Transfer CFT must be an administrator on the system where you are performing the installation.

### Get help

To access the installation help:
