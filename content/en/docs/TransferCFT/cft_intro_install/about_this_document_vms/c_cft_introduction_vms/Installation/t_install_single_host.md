---This section describes how to install Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion  >}} on a single host. As described in this section, you may opt to run multiple instances of Transfer CFT on a single host to optimize the hardware architecture, for example.

To begin the procedure:

1. Select the single host option to perform a classic Transfer CFT installation:
    ```
    Installation type: Single host or multiple hosts. \* Single host(1) - Multiple hosts (2)........... [ 1
    ]:
    ```
1. Specify the root and shared directories for components to install. The default directory is the login directory for the Transfer CFT account.
    ```
    Single Host.
    Specify the root and shared directories for components to install. \* Installation Directory [AXP2$DKB400:[MYDIRPATH]]: AXP2$DKB400:[ MYDIRPATH]
    ```
1. Set the multi-node option. If you want to install Transfer CFT on a single host but run multiple instances of Transfer CFT, set the multi-node option to (Y)es. If you activate multi-node, you are prompted to enter the number of Transfer CFT nodes, from 2 to 4 nodes.
    ```
     \* Enable the multi-node architecture Y/N [N]
