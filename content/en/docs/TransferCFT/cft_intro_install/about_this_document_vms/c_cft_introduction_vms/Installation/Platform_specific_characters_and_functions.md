---Certain characters have a unique meaning in commands as well as in the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} configuration.

On z/OS and IBM i platforms you should check the page code used by your local system. For example, x'5B' is the pound character (£) if you are using the United Kingdom EBCDIC page code 285, but is the dollar character ($) in the French EBCDIC page code 297. For more information, please refer to the Wikipedia [code page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page).
