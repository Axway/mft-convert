}Silent mode, also referred to as the auto-answer option, enables you to perform a non-interactive installation where you do not need to manually enter parameters in the console.

To use silent mode, you must first install {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} and create a template answer file in your `sys$update` directory. You can then use this file to duplicate installations on other machines without repeatedly running the installer and entering the same parameters, as the silent mode takes the parameter values from existing or generated answer files.
