}Transfer CFT activities are tracked using the:

- Transfer CFT Catalog, which can be queried by CFTUTIL, Copilot, and CFTAPI
- Transfer CFT LOG, a file designated by the CFTLOG configuration command [A]FNAME parameter. This file contains, for example, INIT COMPLETE, SEND TREATED and SERVER SESSION OPENED
- Message queue echoing the Transfer CFT logging associated with the user designated by NOTIFY in the CFTLOG command:

> -   Specific values: `NOTIFY='______'  / NOTIFY='OP______'`
> -   Echo level: `OPERMSG= 0 to 255`

When monitoring operating incidents, information may be logged in the:

- Message queue that receives specific incident messages from the interface functions; by default, the function associated with the submitter user (same as NOTIFY='______')
- QSYSOPR message queue that receives messages generated by specific network or work-management commands, and any Transfer CFT file and data management error messages
- JOBLOG (history message queue and QPJOBLOG spool file), LOGCLPGM parameter in the \*JOBD:

> Logging level (0 to 4) (default = 4)
>
> Severity level (00 to 99) (default = 50)
>
> MSGQ -&gt; spool copy control (\*MSG/\*SECLVL/\*NOLIST)  
> (default = \*NOLIST)

- {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400  >}} LOG (QHST) which records job start and end times, status changes for network objects and so on
- Interactive log file (DSPJOBLOG)

The output spool files (QPRINT) contain:

- CFTUTIL batch execution reports
- Messages corresponding to CFT logging, if Transfer CFT is run without a LOG file (without the CFTLOG command)
- Any traces taken at function level
- Any network traces
- Reports from procedures submitted by Transfer CFT (see the transfer variables that can be retrieved as symbolic variables)

CFT ACCNT, accounting, the file designated by the CFTACCNT configuration command [A]FNAME parameter, is used to store information on all terminated transfers.

> **Note**
>
> Note: The file and data management systems display a system code (40000000 &lt; SC &lt; 5FFFFFFF) if an error is detected on transferred files. An associated error label, when it is not stored in any of the ways described above, can be retrieved from a file containing all CFT file management system error codes and labels:DSPPFM FILE (CFTPGM/FMDM3ERR).The hexadecimal value of the error code must be used in the search profile.

In the line-sharing mode, unlike the exclusive mode, Transfer CFT checks the status of the line without implementing it. If the line is not operational, a message is displayed:

```
From.....:   CFT           06/12/17   15:56:04
CF1LX021   : This line is out of order.
```

After it has been implemented manually:

```
CF1LX021 line implemented.
From.....:   CFT           06/12/17   15:56:04
CF1LX021   : Now this line is operational.
```

All messages stored in the log are described in the Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion  >}} User's Guide sub-book ****Messages and Codes****. There are a few exceptions when messages are not stored in the log, for example messages that are self-explanatory and OS related.

For more information, refer to the Transfer CFT User Guide.
