File types
----------

The following table lists the different types of files that can be used according to the type of data to be sent when using IFS.

> **Note**
>
> Note: The FRECFM possibilities for all FTYPE are: ‘V’, ‘F’, and ‘ ’ .


| FTYPE  | Type of sent file  |
| --- | --- |
| ‘S’  | Text  |
| ‘D’ , ‘ ’  | Text  |
| ‘E’  | Text  |
| ‘Z’  | Binary  |
| ‘J’  | Stream text is an alternative way to transfer a text file. Every line of a file must end with an LF or CR/LF. However, during a transfer the CR/LF are changed to LFs. This enables a quicker reading, and a faster transfer.<br/> When using stream text (FTYPE=J), the sender and the receiver must both have the FTYPE set to J. Setting only the sender or receiver to FTYPE=J results in unexpected content for the transferred file.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> Note: This transfer mode is not available for native side transfers.<br/> </blockquote>  |


****Key****

When sending a file from the part of an IBM i machine in text mode, the file is expected to be a standard text file. This means that every line of the file to transfer is finished either by a LF, either by a CR/LF. If not, the file is considered to be binary and Transfer CFT cannot read it. Use the binary mode to allow it to be transferred.

Sending a group of IFS files
----------------------------

### Send using a generic name

This section describes how to send a group of files using a send command where there is one transfer per file.

When defining the filename, you must put a &lt;file-symb&gt; character (system-specific) before the FNAME parameter value. {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400  >}} environments use the ‘\#’ and ‘£’ symbols.

Use one of the following commands to send a group of files using a generic name:

`SEND FNAME=#path_name/wildcards`

Or:

`CFTSEND FNAME=#path_name/wildcards`

The FNAME parameter is set to a generic name that includes wildcard characters. In this type of send, only the selected files are sent.

A receiving Transfer CFT can specify the name of each file received via the symbolic variables:

- ?FPATH the file path of the sending file, and
- ?FROOT the file name of the sending file

****Example****

- CFTSEND

`FNAME = “#/home/send/FIC*.*”, FRECVFM = V`

- CFTRECV

`FNAME = “/home/recv/?FROOT”, `

`FRECVFM = V`

### Send using an IFS file that contains a list of files

These rules apply to the structure of the file containing a list of files:

- A record can contain only one file name
- Each file name must be listed in the first column
- The file names must be written in EBCDIC

****Example****

Enter:

`CFTSEND FNAME = “#/home/send/FICLIST”, FRECVFM = V`

If the file FICLIST contains the following lists:

- /home/send/FIC1
- /home/send/FIC2
- /home/send/FIC3

Then the files FIC1, FIC2 and FIC3 are sent.
