---This section describes the specific requirements for TCP/IP in a Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400  >}} environment.

## Interface level used

The interface is a SOCKET type.

## Execution environment

A TCP/IP network must be installed and configured before the Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400  >}} product is installed. Use the STRTCP command to start the TCP/IP environment. The configured servers are then started.

## Network environment

### Local domain and host name

1. To configure the domain and host names, enter **GO CFGTCP**.
1. In the *CFGTCP menu*, select the ****Changes local domain and host names**** option and modify the local domain and host names for your IBM i. The host name is used in the CFTNET command HOST parameter when the Transfer CFT/400 monitor is configured.

### Host table

Each host with which you wish to transfer files must be declared in this table.

To do so, select the ****WORK WITH TCP/IP HOST TABLE ENTRIES**** option in the *CFGTCP menu*.

### TCP/IP interface

Each domain with which you wish to transfer files must be declared in an interface.

To do so, select the **WORK WITH TCP/IP INTERFACE** option in the *CFGTCP menu* and add an interface.

A partner address of 192.1.1.1 and the 255.255.255.0 mask are used to separate the network identifier part (192.1.1) from the host identifier part (1). For a site with the same network identifier, you do not need to configure another network interface.

### TCP/IP port restrictions

The SAPs used in the Transfer CFT configuration commands must be declared as ports for the TCP/IP protocol. They must also be associated with the Transfer CFT user profile.

> **Note**
>
> Ports 1 to 1023 are reserved and must not be used by Transfer CFT.

### Checking the network configuration

The PING command is used to test the connection with your partner.

To do so, enter the PING command on an {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400  >}} command line, followed by the name of the host to be tested. The test results are displayed on the message line.

## Precautions

Any incidents detected impact the following:

- Security  
    To start TCP, you do not need to have a user profile set to \*IOSYSCFG, but it may be required for some Transfer CFT configuration commands in the TCP/IP environment: the {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryForOS400 >}} messages are explanatory.

Network interface is not started after the ENDTCPIFC command:

You can start the network interface via the WORK WITH TCP/IP INTERFACE option in the CFGTCP menu, or the STRTCPIFC or NESTAT command if the STRTCP command has already been called.
