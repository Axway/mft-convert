---The system user control (USERCTRL) feature allows Transfer CFT to read and write files and execute processing procedures on behalf a user other than the one who operates Transfer CFT.

To enable this feature, in addition to setting the CFTPARM:USERCTRL parameter to YES, the user operating Transfer CFT requires the \*ALLOBJ special authority.
