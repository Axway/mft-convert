The Transfer CFT system interfaces generate z/OS operator messages that display on the system console, and appear when:

- A severe error is detected by a system function

<!-- -->

- Or the corresponding SGTRACE trace is active

> **Note**
>
> Certain OS specific messages that are auto-documented, CFDMnnx, CARMnnx, CCFTnnx, CFRNnnx, CFCAnnx, and CFTInnx, may not be detailed in this document. These messages are considered self-explanatory.

## System interface message definitions

The messages have the following format:

- 4 letters corresponding to the system interface

<!-- -->

- 2 digits to number the messages

<!-- -->

- 1 classification letter

<!-- -->

- The message text
