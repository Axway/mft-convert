}System Authorization Facility (SAF) based PKI offers a more secure SSL. The optional SAF method uses RACF, or the equivalent, and an optional cryptographic coprocessor to increase data security. To enable the SAF mode of operation you must:

1. Enable the IBM Crypto Express 2 Coprocessor, if available.
1. Configure the IBM ICSF program to use a secure PKDS database.
1. Install and configure the option for Transfer CFT.
1. Define RACF.

<!-- -->

1. Define the CFTSSL PARM fields or ROOTCID/USERCID fields.

> **Note**
>
> Note: A SAF PKI implementation in Transfer CFT requires that the â€˜ring-specific profile checking' (RDATALIB class) be activated.
