--- The HFS Hierarchical File System data architecture is consecutive and non- structured for records and blocks. The HFS files are installed in hierarchical disk spaces, and divided into directories and sub- directories according to UNIX conventions.

HFS files are managed either by applications that work in an UNIX/OMVS environment, or by applications that use the USS UNIX System Services, such as the management and access interface.

Transfer CFT only accepts the complete name from the root directory. All file name components are separated by the ‘/’ character. The complete name is limited to 248 characters.

The z/OS file characteristics, such as format (RECFM), record size (LRECL), and block size (BLKSIZE) are meaningless for an HFS file. However, Transfer CFT uses these characteristics as a basis for ensuring the data management and the transmission of file characteristics towards the receiver for a transfer. As a result, parameter settings must take these characteristics into account when characteristics are conveyed between heterogeneous partners.

Transfer CFT z/OS can only access HFS files for a transfer. This excludes any other use in the Transfer CFT. This means that Transfer CFT z/OS:

- Does not support generic sending of HFS in homogeneous mode.
- The CFTUTIL utility COPYFILE function does not work with HFS files.

## HFS file names

File names coded in the FNAME=, WFNAME=, and NFNAME= parameters must follow the UNIX conventions for file identification. This means that the files values for the parameters associated with FNAME=, and WFNAME= parameters must be coded between quotes “…”.

However, as the value for the NFNAME= parameter is not converted to upper case, it should not be coded between quotes “…”.

**Example**

`FNAME ="/home/qualcft/send/SEND.File.Lowercase" `

`NFNAME= '/home/qualcft/recv/Recv.File.Lowercase' `

or

` /home/qualcft/recv/Recv.File.Lowercase`

`To enable recursive processing for a group of files, use the following syntax ** (two asterisks). To select all files in all of the folders, for example: `

```
FNAME =/home/qualcft/\*\*
```

> **Note**
>
> A single asterisk \* only selects the file in the immediate folder.

### HFS file characteristics

HFS files are specified by their type, depending on whether they contain text (structured) or are binary (non- structured). The FTYPE= and NTYPE= parameters convey the file type.

The values allocated to TYPE are:

- T: text file
    - This file is structured
    - The logical records are limited
    - Transfer CFT treats the data in record mode

<!- - - - >

- B: binary file
    - This file is non- structured
    - Transfer CFT treats the data in continuous flow

<!- - - - >

- J: stream text
    - Enables sending a text file that contains records that are larger than 32 KB

If the parameter is not present, the binary file type becomes the default type.

### RECFM, LRECL, and BLKSIZE characteristics

The RECFM, LRECL and BLKSIZE parameters retain their characteristics when they are conveyed between heterogeneous partners.

Transfer CFT uses these parameter characteristics as a basis for ensuring data management for a transfer. For this reason, parameter settings must take into account the following:

- Transfer CFT interprets the file format (FRECFM= and NRECFM=) to select a data exchange method. If this parameter is not present, V is the default value.
- Transfer CFT interprets the size of a logical record (FLRECL= and NRECL=) to adapt the size of exchanged articles. If this parameter is not present, 4096 is the default value.
- The size of a block is ignored (FBLKSIZE= and NBLKSIZE=) and is set to 0.
- The LRECL for text files is limited to 32,752 bytes. Some JAVA/XML applications create non delimited text files, not supported by Transfer CFT.

### HFS file owner and access rights 

An HFS file owner, or attribute, is characterized by:

- A UID (user number)
- A GID (group number)
- A string that specifies access rights

Transfer CFT z/OS manages the file owner and the access rights in two ways:

- Transfer CFT is an authorized program and the CFTPARM USERCTRL parameter is set to YES.  
    As a result, files are created/read/written with the same rights as the requesting user. This is the recommended operating mode.

<!- - - - >

- Otherwise, the HFS files are created/read/written with the rights of the Transfer CFT. It is recommended that you assign a UID to the Transfer CFT that is not 0.

When a received transfer leads to the creation of an HFS file, the file is created with the access right - rwxr- xr- x.

Before Transfer CFT z/OS creates a file, it checks that enough space is available in the File System. If not, Transfer CFT refuses the creation, and returns error code 00F00B37.

Transfer CFT handles HFS files smaller than 4 terabytes.

Changing the name of an HFS file can only be carried out in the same directory. Additionally, the file path that is described in the FNAME= parameter must be identical to the path specified in the WFNAME=parameter.

### HFS- specific error message

For each HFS file access error, Transfer CFT z/OS displays the CFTHF01E message in the SYSLOG.

```
CFHF01E:BPX1mod ,RSN=05F1006C,RC=ENOENT (129)No such file or directory
```

Where:

- BPX1mod: Name of the service module that returned the error

<!- - - - >

- RSN=xxxxxxxx: The returned reason code

Refer to the IBM brochure *UNIX System Services Messages & Codes*.

- RC=: The return code in abbreviated mnemonic (numeric) form
