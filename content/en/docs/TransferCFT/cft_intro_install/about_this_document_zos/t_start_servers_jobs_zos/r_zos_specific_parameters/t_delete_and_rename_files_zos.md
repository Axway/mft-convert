## About files

When renaming a file, Transfer CFT z/OS only releases the unused space if authorized to do so (APF), and if the file is allocated on a single volume. All files deleted by Transfer CFT are removed from the catalog.

* SAM files are deleted/renamed by CAMLST

<!-- -->

* PDS members are deleted/renamed by STOW

<!-- -->

* VSAM files are deleted/renamed by dynamic calling to IDCAMS

### Overwrite PDS members

The CFTRECV MACTION=REPLACE parameter controls the overwriting of any PDS file members received.

The CFTRECV command MACTION=REPLACE parameter controls the files that are received from the ADRDSSU utility DUMP.

## Share Transfer CFT files

File sharing characteristics include:

* Transfer CFT VSAM files are allocated as DISP=SHR

<!-- -->

* Read transfer files are allocated as DISP=SHR

<!-- -->

* Write files are allocated as DISP=OLD

### GRS multi-system protection

Transfer CFT uses QNAME CFTSHARE to protect various resources. QNAME CFTSHARE must be propagated in all members of a GRS configuration. This is the only QNAME to be propagated.

Transfer CFT uses the following other QNAMEs:

* CFTFILES to protect transferred files
* CFTSUBM to serialize JOBS submitted on the Internal Reader

<!-- -->

* CFTPUTS for general internal serialization

<!-- -->

* CFTCATSH to share the catalog dataspace

The CFTFILES ENQs do not need to be broadcast to all systems in the GRS RING.
