---## SMP/E FMIDs list

The Transfer CFT software has a SYSMOD FMID (Function Module ID) that identifies the software and its release number. For example, FMID TCF0300 identifies the Transfer CFT 3.3.2 release.


| FMID | Format |
| --- | --- |
| TCF0100 |   |


## Upload the SMP/E package to the mainframe

1. Unzip the package file, for example Transfer_CFT_3.3.2_install_mvs_BNnnnnnnnn.smpe.zip.
1. Run the setup.bat (Windows) or setup.sh (Unix).
1. Enter the following parameters in the console. Upon completion you require an FTP client.


| Question | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset name for the product SMPE samples | AXWAY.SMPE.CFT332.SMPCNTL |
| USS SMP/E Network Temporary Store | /home/AXWAY/smpnts |
| USS package subdirectory | CFT332 |
| Hostname mainframe address<br/> Login user<br/> Login password |  <br/>  |


- The setup procedure allocates the destination library dataset (default is AXWAY.SMPE.CFT332.SMPCNTL),  
    with the attributes recfm=fb,lrecl=80,blksize=27920,space=(cyl,(1,5)).
    -   To add a volume or device name, edit the &vol= or &unit= field in the silent_smpe_install.conf file.
- The sample member $C\* is transferred to the dataset using FTP in text mode.
- The setup procedure creates the destination USS directory (default is /home/AXWAY/smpnts), and subdirectory (default is CFT332).
- The Transfer_CFT_mvs.pax.Z SMP/E package file is transferred to the subdirectory using FTP in binary mode, and renamed to CFT332.pax.Z  (approximately 150 Mbytes).

### Silent mode

You can run the setup procedure in silent mode, `setup –s`. In this case, you do not have to enter parameters in the console, but prior to starting you must update the s`ilent_smpe_install.conf` file located in the install directory.

## Create a new Transfer CFT SMP/E environment

The user ID you use must have read access to the SAF facility class resources GIM.CMD.command and GIM.PGM.program, for example PERMIT GIM.\* CLASS(FACILITY) ID(user ID) ACCESS(READ).

1. Edit the sample jobs in the following table, modifying as necessary; supply a valid JOB JCL card statement, select and modify the dataset qualifier &HLQ&, and the optional device &UNIT& and volume &VOLUME&.  
    
| Member Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $C01DCSI | Allocate the SMP/E CSI, and the operational and work data sets used by SMP/E. |
| $C02DZON | Define the SMP/E distribution and target zones. |

1. Submit the jobs in the order listed.

## Receive the Transfer CFT SMP/E product

1. Edit the sample job listed in the following table, modifying as necessary; supply a valid JOB JCL card statement, select and modify the dataset qualifier &HLQ&.  
    
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $C10RECV | UNPAX the archive package and RECEIVE the FMIDs functions. |

1. Submit the job.  
    The following data sets (approximately 300 cylinders) are created and suffixed by their corresponding FMID identifier (TCF0nnn) and RELFILEs number (Fn).

## Install the target libraries with SMP/E

1. Edit the sample jobs that are listed in the following table, modifying as necessary; supply a valid JOB JCL card statement, select and modify the dataset qualifier &HLQ& and the optional device &UNIT& and volume &VOLUME&.

| --- | --- |
| $C20ALLT | Allocate the Target libraries. |
| $C30FAPP | Perform an APPLY (with the CHECK operand) to install the SYSMOD functions in the target zone and libraries. |


1. Submit the jobs in the order listed.  
    If the $C30FAPP return code equals zero, edit $C30FAPP, remove the CHECK command, and resubmit the job.  
    The $C20ALLT job creates, and the $C30FAPP job updates, the following data sets (approximately 300 cylinders).
