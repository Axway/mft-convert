To manually install, you can run the following JOBs.

<span id="JOB B20LINK LINK- EDIT Transfer CFT "></span><span id="kanchor9"></span>

## LINK- EDIT Transfer CFT using JOB B20LINK

You should only use this JCL for non- SMP/E installations.

The B20LINK JOB does a LINK- EDIT of Transfer CFT z/OS modules. Programs that are created in this step use the DLL mechanism.

Before beginning it is recommended that you save the execution listing for this JOB.

The CFTMAIN/CFTMA31 programs are copied in an authorized APF library for the cases in which Transfer CFT:

- Writes ACCOUNT records to SMF.

<!- - - - >

- Uses the RACF options.

<!- - - - >

- Sends messages to TSO users.

<!- - - - >

- Uses dynamic UCBs (DRM) or UCBs that are defined in 31 bits in IODF.

<!- - - - >

- Uses the ARM services.
- Uses a shared catalog cache.
- Frees unused space for received files.

> **Note**
>
> The return code generated by the LINK- EDIT must be 0.

> **Note**
>
> IMPORTANT - If you have applied a patch, resubmitting the JCL B20LINK resets all the executable files generated by this procedure to their original versions and therefore cancels any and all applied patches.

<span id="COPA010 Setting up the CFT Navigator server files in USS "></span><span id="kanchor10"></span>

## Set up Copilot server files in USS using COPA010

The files that are used by the Transfer CFT Copilot server are located in the USS environment. The implementation directory is defined by the coppath parameter (cf A03PARM member in INSTALL library).

### Prerequisites

- Authorization to create the directory: coppath

<!- - - - >

- Available disk space: 25,000 K

### **Procedure**

You can use the JCL COPA010 to set up the Transfer CFT Copilot files in USS.

1. Extract the Transfer CFT Copilot package from the distribution libraries in a temporary sequential file with a fixed format.
1. Transfer and install the files that are used by Transfer CFT Copilot. Use the pax command via a REXX procedure to perform this task. 
1. Execute the command: pax - rvf "//'tempory.seq.fix’" - o saveext

> **Note**
>
> The file access rights are Read only for Group and others. Users must have rights to read the file system where the Transfer CFT Copilot USS files are installed. To get the file system name, enter the command: df .

**Example**

```
/home/AXWAY/CFT/copilot> df .Mounted on Filesystem Avail/Total Files Status
/home/AXWAY (xxxxxx.yyyyy.HFSAXWAY) 235680/1872000 4294927912 Available
```
