## Version

The minimum z/OS version depends on the JES:

* If you use the JES2 component, then you require z/OS 2.1 or higher
* If you use the JES3 component, then you require z/OS 2.2 or higher

## Version format

To accommodate changing product versions, we use the convention &lt;version> in place of the actual version number in samples and lists.

For example if your Transfer CFT is version 3.3.x, the file ZOS/CFT/&lt;version> would be ZOS/CFT/3.3.x.

## Delivery - distribution method

Axway delivers Transfer CFT z/OS on the support site: [support.axway.com](https://support.axway.com/). To download the packages from Axway support, you require a user ID and password.

There are three Transfer CFT packages available on the Axway support site - 2 packages for the standard Transfer CFT installation method (which differ only in file format, ADRDSSU or XMIT), and additionally the SMP/E Transfer CFT installation package.

Again, there are 2 product packaging formats in the **`Components\Transfer_CFT_V<version>_mvs\install`** directory:

* `\adrdssu  `
* `\xmit `
