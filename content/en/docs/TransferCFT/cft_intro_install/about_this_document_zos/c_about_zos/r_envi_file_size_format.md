---This section describes the installation environment and the space requirements for installation.

A *distribution* environment is created during the product retrieval phase of the installation. This distribution environment contains the transferred files that provide the product contents, as well as any installed upgrades.

The Transfer CFT *instance* is the environment that the user configures for operational use, and is created from the distribution environment. File sizes in the user target environment are defined in the JCL J2IICFT. This JCL is defined twice - in the UPLIB library, and in the INSTALL library of the distribution environment.

The tables in this section provide information about the files and allocation requirements for the distribution and instance environments. Note that an ESD installation requires an additional 1100 disk cylinders (3390 disk) of space.

* The *Instance environment* list above does not include files that Transfer CFT creates in its implementation, such as CATALOG, PARM, PART, COM, PKIFILE, LOG, ACCOUNT etc.
* The persistent cache file for PassPort AM (CFTAM, VSAM KSDS) is created when the UCONF AM.type=passport variable is set to ****Yes****.
* To customize INSTALL, SAMPLE, EXEC and UPARM THE library must be PDS and not PDSE.
