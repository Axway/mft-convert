Transfer CFT HP NonStop provides a start-process supervisor (CFTSUP) that can restart the Transfer CFT server or UI server in case of an unexpected stop. This section presents the following NonStop information:

- [Overview](#Overview): describes the non-stop feature and compares it with the NonStop functionality delivered in previous versions
- [Enable](#Enable): how to activate the non-stop mode
- [Configure](#Configur): how to set additional non-stop mode parameters
- [Syntax](#Syntax): the commands and their syntax
    -   [Messages](#Conventi): provides examples of using CFTSUP commands and returned messages
- [Help](#Help): information on using command line help

<span id="Overview"></span>

Overview
--------

The CFTSUP interface consist of:

- A component watchdog called the supervisor
- A utility that allows you to:
    -   Start and stop the supervisor
    -   Start and stop the Transfer CFT server and Transfer CFT Copilot server
    -   Display the status of these components

The differences between the CFTSUP interface and the NonStop mode delivered in Transfer CFT 2.3 are:

- The Transfer CFT server and Transfer CFT Copilot server are both managed in NonStop mode.
- The CFTSUP interface replaces the former CFTNSMON and CFTNSHUT commands.
- Transfer CFT stops and is not restarted unless the reset command is set to` RESTART=YES` when you execute the Transfer CFT command `CFTUTIL SHUT <...`&gt;.

Enable NonStop mode
-------------------

This section describes how to enable the NonStop mode and start Transfer CFT.

1. Activate the option:
1. Start the Transfer CFT server, for example, using the supervisor:
1. Optionally, check the Transfer CFT server status. For example:

More information and additional commands are described in the following sections.

### Recommendations

- You can use the `cftsup cft start `command to start Transfer CFT, which also starts the supervisor. However, this does not mean the NonStop mode is running. To implement the NonStop mode, you must activate `cft.guardian.nonstop` in the UCONF configuration.
- If you need to kill the Transfer CFT server, for example, use the `cftsup cft kill` command to keep the component from restarting.

<span id="Configur"></span>

Configure
---------

The following table lists the UCONF parameters related to the NonStop option configuration. See the [UCONF parameters](../../intro_os_features/hp_ns_batch#UCONF) descriptions for more detailed information.


| Parameter  | Default value  | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cft.guardian.nonstop  | No  | Enable the nonstop mode.<br/> • Yes: Activate<br/> • No: Deactivate |
| cft.guardian.collector  | &lt;no value&gt;  | Name of the EMS collector where the supervisor sends messages. See [Customize the EMS collector](#Customiz) for details.  |
| cft.guardian.processor  | -1  | Processor on which Transfer CFT is started.  |
| cft.guardian.backup_processor  | -1  | Backup processor on which Transfer CFT is started.  |
| cft.guardian.process_name_prefix  | LA  | The first two letters of the Guardian process names.  |

### Customize the EMS collector

To use the same collector for the supervisor as for {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName  >}} log messages, perform the following steps:

1. Set the uconf `cft.guardian.collector` value to the name of the collector.  
    ```
    CFTUTIL uconfset id=cft.guardian.collector,value='$QACOL'
    ```
1. In the Transfer CFT configuration, modify the CFTLOG definition to: `NOTIFY=’%uconf:cft.guardian.collector%’. F`or example`:`  
    ```
    CFTLOG ID = 'LOG0',

    > FNAME = '_CFTLOG',
    > AFNAME = '_CFTLOGA',
    > ...
    > NOTIFY = ’%uconf:cft.guardian.collector%’,
    > CONTENT = 'FULL',
    > ...

    ```

1. Interpret the modified CFTLOG object.

Syntax
------

****Format****

`cftsup [component] Actions [Options]`

Where:

`component [ALL &#124; SUPV &#124; CFT &#124; COPILOT]`

- ALL (default): Action applies to all components
- SUPV: Watchdog utility
    -   Process is started with the name: prefix added to SUP
        -   For example: `CFTL50I Started the supervisor with process id $`**`LASUP`**
        -   Prefix = cft.guardian.process_name_prefix (the prefix in the example is `LA`)
    -   Stops when all components are terminated except if it was started explicitly as standalone process:
    -   cftsup SUPV START
    -   In this case, it only stops with an explicit stop:
    -   cftsup SUPV STOP
- CFT: Action applies to the Transfer CFT server
- COPILOT: Action applies to Transfer CFT Copilot server

`Actions [ START &#124; STOP &#124; STATUS &#124; KILL &#124; SHUT (for Transfer CFT server only)]`

- KILL is only valid for the Transfer CFT and Transfer CFT Copilot servers.

> **Note**
>
> Note: The SHUT option only apply to the Transfer CFT sever.

- CFTUTIL SHUT FAST=YES the equivalent is cftsup CFT SHUT FAST=YES

Help
----

From the home directory, enter the `help `command. For example:

```
/home/axway/<user>: cftsup help
 
Syntax: cftsup [ALL&#124;CFT&#124;COPILOT&#124;SUPV] Actions [Options]
: cftsup ? (or HELP) for a list of the component and actions
: cftsup Component ? (HELP) for actions to perform on components
```

Use `command ?` to display the parameter list:

```
/home/axway/<user>: cftsup "action" ?
```
