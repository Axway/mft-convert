## Platform specific parameters and values

****ATTSUSER****

Use the ATTSUSER parameter to set specific attributes for receiving native files. This parameter can take three values, FCODE, FORMAT, and BUFFERED.

****FCODE****

Forces the file CODE attribute. This value should be consistent with the file structure and the restrictions of the system. If FCODE is not specified, Transfer CFT sets the code per the table iah,n Figure 5.

****Example****: `ATTSUSER    = 'FCODE=180'`

The received file is created with 180 as the code.

****FORMAT****

Forces the file FORMAT attribute. This value is either 1 or 2. If FORMAT is not specified, Transfer CFT sets the format according to the estimated size of the received file. A file whose size is greater than 2GB has the format 2, while a file having a size less than 2GB has the format 1.

****Example****: `ATTSUSER    = 'FORMAT=2'`

The received file is created with the format 2.

****Use multiple values****

Additionally, you can use multiple values:

****Example****: `ATTSUSER    = ' FCODE=180,FORMAT=1'`

The received file is created with the format 1, and 180 as the code.

****BUFFERED****

If specified, this parameter forces the BUFFERED attribute for the Guardian file. The possible values are 0 (NO BUFFERED) and 1 (BUFFERED). If not specified, Transfer CFT does not force the attribute. You can find more information on this attribute in the *File Utility Program (FUP) Reference Manual*.

**Example**: `ATTSUSER = 'BUFFERED=1'`

The received file is created with a BUFFERED attribute set.

> **Note**
>
> If a received file has the BUFFERED option, the file write cache is flushed while the PeSIT synchronization points are set. This means that there is no data loss (the file is not altered) if the file transfer is restarted. This applies whether BUFFERED is set on Transfer CFT or by an explicit file creation operation.
