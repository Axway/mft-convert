}Remove all Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesReleaseNumber  >}} files to uninstall; there is no automatic uninstall procedure.

When you uninstall a Transfer CFT, you lose the complete Transfer CFT configuration. To avoid this, save your environment such as samples, exits, etc, before removing the Transfer CFT. Make sure that no Transfer CFT related process (server, Copilot, CFTUTIL, API,…) is running before uninstalling.
