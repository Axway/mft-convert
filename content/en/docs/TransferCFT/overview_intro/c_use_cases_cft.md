--- This section describes the general types of implementation when using {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}, either with multiple {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}s or in conjunction with other {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesCompanyName  >}} products.

- Distributed A2A transfer exchanges
- Centralized A2A transfer exchanges
- B2B Internet- based transfer
- Human file transfer

## Distributed A2A transfer exchanges

A distributed exchange implementation is ideal for implementing back- end application exchanges internally within your corporate network. The implementation is based on Transfer CFT and {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}}.

Use cases include:

- Multi- site integration
- Application integration

## Centralized A2A transfer exchanges

A centralized exchange implementation allows easy integration of new applications and processing flows, while ensuring performance- based, monitored, and secure transactions. All transactions are end- to- end with technical and functional monitoring.

implementation typically meets the needs of the store- to- corporate use case when the data exchanges are confined to the corporate network. The implementation is based on Transfer CFT and Flow Manager or {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}}.

Use cases include:

- Multi- site integration
- Application integration

## B2B Internet- based transfer implementation

A combination implementation covers all B2B and A2A exchanges.

## Human file transfer

Human- to- human and human- to- system (H2\*) transfers are initiated or acted upon by people through a user interface, such as a mail client, web portal, or within a business application. Typical exchanges involve people who need to work together, or people who need to download or upload files consumed or produced by enterprise information system applications.
