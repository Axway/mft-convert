You can deploy a single Central Governance instance with one computer per network. The system supports active/passive resiliency, and can bring another instance of Central Governance online if the primary fails.

> Flow Manager offers services that are similar to Central Governance, but with the addition of predefined templates and APIÂ functionality in a container setting.
