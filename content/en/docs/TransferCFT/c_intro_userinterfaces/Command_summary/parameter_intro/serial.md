### serial

#### SEND/RECV CFTSEND/CFTRECV

****[SERIAL ={ <span class="underline">' '</span> &#124; Y &#124; X } ]****

When sending files sequentially, this value is the processing phase that a serialized transfer must reach before Transfer CFT begins executing the next transfer. For details on processing phases, see [About phase and phasestep](../../../../concepts/phase_and_phasestep).

Use this parameter to define file transfer serialization in flows, where:

- ' ' : no serialization occurs (default)
- Y: Post-processing
- X: Done

See also, [Transfer serialization](../../../../app_integration_intro/transfer_serialization).
