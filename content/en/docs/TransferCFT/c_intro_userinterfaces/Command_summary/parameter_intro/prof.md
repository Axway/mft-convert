****[PROF = {SIT &#124; CFT &#124; EXTERN &#124; ANY &#124; DMZ }]****

PeSIT
D or E protocol profile

The profile options are:

****SIT profile****: the
PeSIT is then used in the SIT network context. This is the same in PeSIT version D and version E. It provides synchronization point management but does
not manage:

- segmentation:
    the value of the SEGMENT parameter must be set to NO (SEGMENT = NO), or
- multi-records:
    the value of the MULTART parameter must be set to NO (MULTART = NO), or
- compression:
    the RCOMP and SCOMP parameters are not applicable, or receive
    transfer requests

> **Note**
>
> A sender
> in the PeSIT SIT profile cannot segment a record sent in several data
> FPDUs or group several records sent in the same data FPDU.

****EXTERN profile****:
Corresponds to the “non-SIT” (external to SIT network) standardized definition
of the PeSIT version D protocol.

****CFT profile****: The
PeSIT version D protocol is used outside the context of the SIT network,
the partner also having a {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}. Its functionality level is greater than the PeSIT
D EXTERN profile specifications.

****ANY profile****: Corresponds
to the “non-SIT” (external to SIT network) standardized definition of
the PeSIT version E protocol. This profile includes {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} profile facilities
as standard.

Additional facilities are provided between two Transfer
CFTs, while conforming with the PeSIT E standard.
These facilities are based on the use of the PI 99 (free PI).

> **Note**
>
> In server mode, the PROF parameter
> can take either the EXTERN, CFT, or ANY values (corresponding to the “non-SIT”
> profiles): indeed, in server mode, the Transfer CFT automatically
> adapts itself to the “non-SIT” profile proposed by the requesting partner.
