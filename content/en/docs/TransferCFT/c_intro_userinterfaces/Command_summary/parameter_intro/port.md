**PORT = (string1..64, string1..64,
…)**

Listening port of the proxy/proxies in the first network.

A listening port may either be expressed in numerical format (between
1 and 65535) or as a service name. You must declare the same number of
PORTs as HOSTs, since the position of the listening port in the list corresponds
to the host address in the same position.
