#### CFTSEND, SEND

`[ EXECSUBPRE = { LIST &#124; FILE &#124; SUBF } ]`

This parameter defines the execution policy for the PREEXEC script. It determines how the transfer requests are treated, and the order in which this occurs.

- <u>LIST</u>: (default) triggers the preprocessing procedure first on the generic request, before launching the requests on the list
- FILE: triggers the preprocessing procedure for each request on the list as well as for the generic request
- SUBF: triggers the preprocessing procedure for each request on the list, except for the generic request
