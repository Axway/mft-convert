******[USERID =
{"<u>Transfer CFT userid</u>" &#124; *string32* }]******

Identifier of the transfer owner.

This parameter is used in server mode
to define the transfer owner associated with a CFTRECV object, or a CFTSEND
IMPL = YES object. If this parameter is not defined, its default value
is the system "userid" of the server {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}.

This field can include one or more of the following symbolic variables:

- ****&PART****:
    value substituted by the local identifier of the transfer partner (CFTPART
    ****id****)
- ****&SUSER****:
    value substituted by the SUSER parameter sent between two {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}}s (PeSIT D CFT profile and PeSIT E protocols)
- &****RUSER****:
    value substituted by the ****ruser****
    parameter sent between two {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}}s (PeSIT D CFT profile
    and PeSIT E protocols)

> **Note**
>
> If a SEND or RECV command is used for the transfer, the identifier
> of the transfer owner is the system "userid" of the user having
> activated the command.

****Windows****

{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} can use domain\\user accounts instead of USER, except when using PassPort AM or internal security. To do so, set the USERID value to the format DOMAIN\\USER.

#### CFTCRON

****z/OS (MVS)****

The USERID value is used to perform the CRONJOB job submission.

****All other platforms****

The CRONJOB is executed by the user who started {{< TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName  >}}; you can use the &USERID variable for information purposes.

#### CFTAPPL, CLEARCMD

******USERID = {*string 32*
}******

#### CFTFOLDER

******USERID = {*string 32*
}******

Identifier for a user who can scan a folder. See the section, [Folder monitoring using USERCTRL](../../../../app_integration_intro/intro_folder_monitor/configure_folder_monitoring#Folder2).

If the USERID is set and the Transfer CFT USERCTRL=YES in the CFTPARM object, the folder monitoring is done on behalf another user.

Maximum length 32 characters.

> **Note**
>
> Using a different user (USERID) is not available on Linux if the event mode is enabled (USEFSEVENTS=YES).

When implementing file user rights with USERCTRL on Windows systems, you must run Transfer CFT as a service. Please see [How to enable system users - Windows](../../../../cft_intro_install/windows_install_start_here/windows_install_start_here/running_cft_for_the_first_time_windows/add_system_user_windows) for more information.
