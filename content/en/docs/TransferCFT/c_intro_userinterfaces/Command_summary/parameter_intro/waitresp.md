### waitresp

#### CFTPARM

****[WAITRESP = {1...32767} ]****

The timeout for internal communication between Transfer CFT
tasks, which can be any
value from ****1**** to ****32767**** seconds.

Default values per operating system:

* 60: Windows, OpenVMS
* 100: UNIX
* 600: z/OS (MVS)
* 1000: OS/400 (IBM i)

This parameter is used for a synchronous exchange of requests between
two monitor tasks during the initialization phase. After ****waitresp****
seconds without reply, the timeout is interrupted. A CFTS09 message is
written in the log and the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} initialization stops.
