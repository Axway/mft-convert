****\[ filtertype = { <u>STRJCMP</u> | EREGEX } \]****

Defines the type of filter to be applied when sending a generic transfer.

- STRJCMP: internally filter matches with \* and ?
- EREGEX: applies a regular expression filter

To replicate the filter behavior of previous Transfer CFTÂ versions, select STRJCMP (default) as the filtertype and leave the [filter](../filter) parameter empty.
