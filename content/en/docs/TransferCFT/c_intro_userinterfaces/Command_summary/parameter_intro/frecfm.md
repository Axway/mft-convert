****[FRECFM = {see the platform specific
*Operations Guide* &#124; F &#124; U &#124; V}]    ****

Record format of the receiver (local) file:

- F:
    fixed
- V:
    variable
- U:
    undefined

The possible values for each system are indicated in the corresponding
*Operations Guide*.

****Receive:****


| **IBM i (OS400), UNIX** | The variable format concept is specific to {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}, and does not correspond to a reality for the systems indicated. A variable format receiver file cannot consequently be interpreted directly by an application, since it contains control information. Unless otherwise specified FRECFM = V is not used. |
| --- | --- |


****Send:****


| **OS400, UNIX** | The variable format concept is specific to {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}, and does not correspond to a reality for the systems indicated. The Transfer CFT can only send a variable format file if this file is generated by a COPYFILE command, or already received by {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} (store and forward, for example). Unless otherwise specified FRECFM = V is not used. |
| --- | --- |


****z/OS (MVS)**** If this parameter is not
defined, the default value is ****U****.
