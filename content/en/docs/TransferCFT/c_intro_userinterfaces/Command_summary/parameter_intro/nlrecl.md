#### CFTSEND, SEND

**[NLRECL = { <u>FLRECL</u>** **<u>value</u>**
**&#124; n}]**

For records of:

- fixed
    format (FRECFM = F) : size in bytes of the records of the receiver file
- variable
    format (FRECFM = V) : maximum size in bytes of the records

When a file is sent, any record sent whose size is GREATER than the
size declared by NLRECL, is truncated to the value of NLRECL.

For records of fixed format (FRECFM=F), if the size of the records to
be sent is LESS than the value of NLRECL, these records are padded up
to the value of NLRECL:

- By
    binary zeros (x00) when the local data is declared as binary FCODE = BINARY
- By
    spaces when the local data are declared as alphanumeric with:
- CODE = ASCII:
    the space character is then equal to x‘20’
