### retryn

#### CFTTCP

****[RETRYN = {4
&#124; n } ]****

Use this field to specify the number of reconnection attempts to make
with a time interval of ****retryw****
between attempts.

****4****: default value

- any
    other value from ****0**** to ****32767****

When ****retryn**** attempts have been
made without success, {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} divides ****retryn****
by two and multiplies ****retryw**** by
two and then begins the sequence again up to the total number of times
specified ****retrym****.

**Example intervals**

If retryw = 1, retryn = 4, retrym =12

In this example the following occurs:

- Four
    retries at one- minute intervals
- Two
    retries at two- minute intervals
- One retry at four- minute intervals
- Five
    retries at eight- minute intervals

**Retry concepts**

When specifying multiple hosts in CFTTCP and PROTs/SAPs in CFTPART, Transfer CFT first retries the host and then the PROT/SAP.

For example, if RETRYN is set to 1 and there are two defined hosts and two PROTs/SAPs as shown here:

```
CFTTCP ...
HOST = ( 'IP1',
'IP2'),
CFTPART ... PROT = ( 'PROT1',
'PROT2),
           SAP = ( 'SAP1',
'SAP2'),
```

The retry order is as follows:

- IP1 SAP1 PROT1 (first host, first protocol)
- IP1 SAP1 PROT1 (retry)
- IP2 SAP1 PROT1 (second host, first protocol)
- IP2 SAP1 PROT1 (retry)
- IP1 SAP2 PROT2 (first host, second protocol)
- IP1 SAP2 PROT2 (retry)
- IP2 SAP2 PROT2 (second host, second protocol)
- IP2 SAP2 PROT2 (retry)
