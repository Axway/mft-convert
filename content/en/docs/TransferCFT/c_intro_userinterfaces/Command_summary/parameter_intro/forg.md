****[FORG = {SEQ &#124; DIRECT &#124; INDEXED}]
  ****

Organization of the file to be transferred:

- SEQ:
    sequential
- INDEXED:
    indexed
- DIRECT:
    direct access (relative)

With certain operating systems, the sequential reception mechanism may
allow data to be loaded into a non-sequential organization file (normally
pre-existing). Depending on the case, the explicit use of parameters such
as FTYPE, FKEYLEN, FKEYPOS and FORG may be required.

For further information, refer to the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} *"Operations
Guide"* corresponding to your OS.
