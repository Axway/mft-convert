    fixed
- V:
    variable

The possible values for each system are indicated in the corresponding
specific Operations Guide. If the output file is compressed (OCOMP
not 0), the value of the ORECFM parameter is forced
to V.

| UNIX | The value "U" is kept for compatibility with previous versions. It has the same meaning as ORECFM=V. |
