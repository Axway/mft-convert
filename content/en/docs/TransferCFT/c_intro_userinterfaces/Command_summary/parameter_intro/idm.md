### idm

#### CFTSEND, SEND

****[IDM = identifier]   {string
33}****

Message identifier.

This identifier does not correspond to a “model” defined by a CFTSEND
object, as in the case for the IDF parameter of the SEND TYPE = FILE,
or TYPE = REPLY command. The value of this identifier is unrestricted.

This identifier may be a search criterion for the catalog entry associated
with this transfer. Several catalog entries can be associated with a given
IDM.
