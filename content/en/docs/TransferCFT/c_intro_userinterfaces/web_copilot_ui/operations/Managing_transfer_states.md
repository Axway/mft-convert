This section describes transfers, and how to create and
manage your transfer operations using {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}.

{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} can execute both file and message transfers. A transfer
consists of a set of processes that result in the exchange of files between
computers. In a transfer, one computer is the sender, the other is the
receiver. The sender and receiver are linked together by a network. A
file transfer may consist of sending a file, group of files, or a message.
