The cft_support tool collects requisite information from your Transfer CFT installation environment, including the static configuration (PARM/PART), Unified Configuration parameters (UCONF), catalog information, communication media file status (CFTCOM), log files, execution environment (variables), disk space, and so on. This information is packaged into a archive file called cft-support-&lt;date&gt;(.tar.gz&#124;.zip).

The report is saved in the Transfer CFT runtime directory by default. You can modify this directory using the UCONF `cft.support_dir` parameter.
