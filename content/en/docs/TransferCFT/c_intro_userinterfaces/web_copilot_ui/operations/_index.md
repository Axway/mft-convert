}This page outlines the operations section of the Transfer CFT user interface:

- Transfers: You can perform a variety of transfer tasks, from creating a new transfer to canceling, restarting, or deleting a transfer request. Additionally, you can use the **Export** feature in the **Catalog** page to generate a CSV file from the list of transfers.
- Log: Displays transfer details and allows you to filter to refine viewing based on a variety of criteria, such as time, severity, and number of records.
- Administration: Enables you to start, stop, and restart Transfer CFT nodes.
- Support: The cft_support tool collects the information from your Transfer CFT installation environment, including the static configuration, Unified Configuration parameters, catalog information, communication media file status, log files, execution environment variables, disk space, and so on. This information is then packaged in an archive file called cft-support-&lt;date&gt;(.tar.gz&#124;.zip).
