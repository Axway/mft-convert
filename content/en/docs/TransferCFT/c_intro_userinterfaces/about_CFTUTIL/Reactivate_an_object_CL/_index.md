---This topic describes the ACT command and its parameters. You can use
the ACT command to reactivate:

- One or more partners (CFTPART)
- Sentinel notifications
- CRON object (CFTCRON)
- Folder object (CFTFOLDER)

****Command guide: [ACT](../../command_summary#ACT)****


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ID](../../command_summary/parameter_intro/id)  | Identifier for the object to be reactivated. To reactivate several objects with a single command, use wildcard characters or meta characters. |
| [MODE](../../command_summary/parameter_intro/mode) | Mode to be reactivated on partners (only when TYPE=PART object):<br/> • BOTH (default)<br/> • REQUESTER<br/> • SERVER<br/> You can use the shortcuts B, R and S in place of the keywords. |
| [TYPE](../../command_summary/parameter_intro/type)  | Object to reactivate:<br/> • PART<br/> • TRK<br/> • CRON<br/> • FOLDER |


## Using the ACT command

Using CFTUTIL you can perform the following commands.

### Activate a partner

****Syntax****

```
ACT TYPE=PART,ID=<CFTPART_ID>,MODE=<mode>
```

Where:

- CFTPART_ID is the identifier for the partner to activate. To activate several partners with a single command, use wildcard characters or meta characters
- Mode is the mode to be activated, with values: "BOTH" , "B", "REQUESTER", "R" , "SERVER", "S"

****Example****

To activate a partner called PARIS in both modes, enter:

```
ACT TYPE=PART, ID=PARIS, MODE=BOTH
```

Returning the following output:

```
CFTU20I Part=PARIS : NOACTIVE -> ACTIVEBOTH
CFTU00I ACT _ Correct (TYPE=PART,ID=PARIS)
```

You can choose to reactivate in either requester or server mode, or
in both modes. However, note that you cannot use the ACT command on a partner if its definition was
provided or modified by a directory EXIT.

When a partner is reactivated, transfer requests that were suspended
by the INACT command:

- Are restarted automatically
    in requester mode (diagnostics code 430)
- Must be restarted
    with the START command in all other cases

### Activate Sentinel notifications

****Syntax****

```
ACT TYPE=TRK
```

All notifications to Sentinel are reactivated. However, the UCONF` sentinel.xfb.enable` parameter must be set to `Yes `to use.

### Activate a CRON object

****Syntax****

```
ACT TYPE=CRON,ID=<CFTCRON_ID>
```

Where `CFTCRON_ID` is the identifier of the CRON object to activate. To activate several CRON objects with a single command, use wildcard characters or meta characters.

****Example****

To activate a CRON referenced by CRON1, enter:

```
ACT TYPE=CRON,ID=CRON1
```

Returning the following output:

```
CFTU20I Cronjob=CRON1 : NOACTIVE -> ACTIVE
CFTU00I ACT _ Correct (TYPE=CRON,ID=CRON1)
```

### Activate a folder object

****Syntax****

```
ACT TYPE=FOLDER,ID=<CFTFOLDER_ID>
```

Where `CFTFOLDER_ID` is the identifier to the folder object to activate. To activate several folder objects with a single command, use wildcard characters or meta characters.

****Example****

To activate the folder referenced by USER1, enter:

```
ACT TYPE=FOLDER,ID=USER1
```

Returning the following output:

```
CFTU20I Folder=USER1 : NOACTIVE -> ACTIVE
CFTU00I ACT _ Correct (type=folder,id=user1)
```

The UCONF` folder_monitoring.enable` parameter must be set to `Yes`, otherwise the folder is not activated even if the state is active.
