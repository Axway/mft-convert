## Displayed catalog information

In the following examples, each field displayed is identified by a number
which makes reference to the associated comment. The display differs according
to the CONTENT and NPART selection parameters.

The following is indicated at the end of the display of the characteristics
of the selected catalog entries:

- The number of entries
    whose characteristics are displayed (n)
- The total number
    of entries recorded in the catalog at the time the LISTCAT command is
    processed (p)
- The number of catalog
    entries still free (q) and the percentage of space still free (r%)

This information is displayed in the following form:

- n records selected
- p records in catalog
    file
- q records free
    (r%)
