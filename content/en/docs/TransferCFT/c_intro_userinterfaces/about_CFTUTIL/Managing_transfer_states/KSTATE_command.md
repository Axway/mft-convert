The KSTATE
command is used to suspend a transfer in the catalog when the Transfer CFTÂ is offline. {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} must
be shut down before the command is run and then restarted. The transfer
must exist in the catalog and be in one of the following phasesteps: in process
<span style="font-weight: bold;">****C****</span>, available <span style="font-weight: bold;">****D****</span>,
or hold <span style="font-weight: bold;">****H****</span>. After execution of
the command, the phasestep is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">****K****</span>.

The command generates a WLOG command which reports the event in the
LOG file.
