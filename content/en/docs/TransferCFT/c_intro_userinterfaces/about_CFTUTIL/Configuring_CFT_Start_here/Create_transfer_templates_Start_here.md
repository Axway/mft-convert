## About the ongoing CFTRECV object

Use the CFTRECV object to:

- Find the name and
    local physical characteristics of the file to receive
- List actions to
    perform locally during and after the transfer (translation, compression,
    call to a user EXIT, an end-of-transfer procedure, etc.)
- View authorized
    time slot and default user associated with the transfers

There is no limit on the number of CFTRECV objects that you can create.
