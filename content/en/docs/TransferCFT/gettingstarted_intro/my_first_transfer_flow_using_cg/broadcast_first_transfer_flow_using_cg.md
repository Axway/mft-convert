Broadcast and collect modes allow you to send files to multiple partners and receiving files from multiple partners using a single command request for each.

## Broadcast

You can use broadcasting to send a file to an entire group of partners in one command, avoiding the task of sending the selected file individually to each of the partners in a flow.

The name of the broadcast list is itself a virtual partner, which contains a list of partners in your flow. This list of partners can be explicit, or it can reference a file that contains the list of partners.

Additionally, you can define what occurs if a partner is unknown, how the scripts are applied to the broadcast list, and so on. [More information](../../../concepts/transfer_command_overview/broadcast_collect)...

| 2 | Enable broadcasting mode. | In the Source Transfer properties, enable Broadcast list. | <a href="../intro_cg_task_catalog/t_defineflow_broadcast#enable_broadcast_cg">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |
| 3 | Deploy the flow. | In {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} click <span >****Deploy**** </span>to save and deploy the flow. | <a href="../intro_cg_task_catalog/t_savedeployflow">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |
| 4 | Create a file for the flow. | For this example, copy a file SALES_report to transfer in the Store_66 {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}<span ><code> runtime/pub </code></span>folder. |   |
| 5 | Execute the SEND command. | From the source {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}, run the following command:<br/> <span ><code>CFTUTIL SEND PART=DEST_stores, IDF=flow04, FNAME=pub/SALES_report</code></span> | <a href="../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |
| 6  | Monitor the file transfer status.  | In {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} select the <span >****Flows**** </span>tab, and click <span >****Monitoring****</span>.  | <a href="../intro_cg_task_catalog/c_flow_monitoring">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |


## Collect

Collecting files is the inverse of using a broadcast list. In the collect transfer mode you can receive a dedicated file from multiple partners (P*n*). This allows the receiver, or flow initiator, to receive a file from all defined partners using a single request command. More information...
