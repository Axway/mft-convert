When you are working in {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} you create *applications* to use in flows. Therefore, if your products did not create applications upon registering, you must create at least two applications to use in your flows.

In this section you create three applications in {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} to represent the <span class="code">`MainOffice`</span>, `Store_66`, and `Store_89`.

### View the registered Transfer CFTs in {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}}

#### In {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}}

Select **Products** on the top toolbar to open the **Product List** page.

| {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 1  | &lt; hostname 3&gt;  | Store_89  |
