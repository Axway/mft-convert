After defining a flow, you can either save it, or save and deploy it. This enables you to prepare a deployment before pushing the configuration to the source and target systems.

- Click <span class="bold_in_para">****Save****</span> to store the flow definition locally in {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM >}}.
- Click <span class="bold_in_para">****Deploy**** </span> to save the definition and push it to the source and target {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName >}} systems.
