The following outlines tasks for defining a flow. Optional steps, such as defining source and target properties, have default values in the user interface and are not described in this getting started topic.

In the <span class="bold_in_para">****Flow List****</span> page click <span class="bold_in_para">****Add flow****</span> and perform the following steps:

1. Select **General information** and complete the fields. The following fields are mandatory (\* denotes mandatory):
    -   Name: Enter a user friendly name, for example <span class="bold_in_para">****Simple flow****</span>
    -   Identifier: Enter the id that will be used in the transfer commands, for example <span class="bold_in_para">****flow01**** </span>(Transfer CFT IDF)
1. In the left panel, select <span class="bold_in_para">****Source**** </span>and click <span class="bold_in_para">****Edit****</span>. The source is the owner of the data being transferred.
1. Select <span class="bold_in_para">****Target**** </span>and click <span class="bold_in_para">****Edit****</span>. The target is the receiver of the exchange.
1. Optionally, select Protocol and define. You cannot define a protocol until you have defined both the source and target.
1. Save the flow, or save and deploy the flow.
