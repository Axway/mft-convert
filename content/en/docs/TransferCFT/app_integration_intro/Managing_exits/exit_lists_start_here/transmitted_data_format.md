## File selection criteria

****Example****

```
PARM LRECL = nnnn, FORMAT=X
SEND STATE = CDHKTX
RECV STATE = CDHKTX
```

Where:

- PARM: General
    parameters
- LRECL: The length
    of the records sent
- FORMAT: Indicates the file format of the communication area.

## Format of sent records

Indicates the file format of the communication area, where values are <u>1</u>, 2 C, T, J, or X (`1 `is the default).

****Format 1****

Displays using the same format as in {{< TransferCFT/headerfootervariableshflongproductname  >}} 3.5 and lower.

- Format V23: The record is truncated if LRECL&lt;503 or padded with spaces if LRECL>503.
- Format V24: The record is truncated if LRECL&lt;1569 or padded with spaces if LRECL>1569.

## Determine the LRECL 

If **LRECL>4096** or **LRECL&lt;109**, the record length is
forced to 503.

- The unused *Cata* field is forced blank or to
    0, in the case of a length.  
    The record is truncated if LRECL&lt;503 or padded with spaces if LRECL>503
    (LRECL is a PARM parameter).
- The **User parameter** field corresponds to the PARM parameter of
    the CFTSEND or SEND command.
- The **Send user** field corresponds to the SUSER parameter of the
    CFTSEND or SEND command.
- The **Receive user** field corresponds to the RUSER parameter of
    the CFTSEND or SEND command.
- The **Local user parameter** field corresponds to the COMMENT parameter
    of the CFTSEND or SEND command for a send transaction or the COMMENT parameter
    of the CFTRECV or RECV command for a receive transaction.

The **Send partner** (SPART) field contains:

- For a send, the
    local partner, the PART parameter of the CFTPARM object
- For a receive,
    the partner identifier, the ID parameter of the CFTPART object

The **Receive partner** (RPART) field contains:

- For a receive,
    the local partner, the PART parameter of the CFTPARM object
- For a send, the
    partner identifier, the ID parameter of the CFTPART object

The commands have the same syntax as CFTUTIL:

**COMMAND** PARAMETER = *value,*
PARAMETER = *value,* etc./\*
Comment \*/

The commands are processed as follows:

- If the criteria
    file is not found, the exit-list generates a file opening error
- The criteria file
    must contain at least one SEND command or one RECV command
- All the commands
    present must include at least one parameter
- The absence of
    a SEND or RECV command implicitly means **no selection**. In the absence
    of a SEND command, no send transfer (SFD, SFH records, etc.) is selected.
    In the absence of a RECV command, no receive transfer (RFD, RFH records,
    etc.) is selected.

### About format version lengths

This section describes the minimum length of a list record including
significant items such as the filename, which depends on the selected version.

****Format version V23****

109 is the minimum length. If n&lt;109 or n>4096, the default value 503 is used.

****Format version V24****

629 is the minimum length. If n&lt;629 or n>4096, the default value 1569 is used.

- SEND = selection
    criteria for send transfers
- RECV = selection
    criteria for received transfers:
    -   STATE: transfer
        status
