---The exit interface provides
the user program with a structure containing information relating to the
transfer. This book describes the end-of-transfer exit. It begins with this topic, which explains the
transfer state and how it relates to an end-of-transfer exit.

The end of transfer type EXIT task enables the user to take control
at the end of a send or receive file or message transfer, independently
of whether or not the transfer is completed.

### Transfer state

The user program can also ask the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} to modify the
transfer state (UPDATE) or to delete the catalog record (DELETE).

The following changes of state are authorized in the event of an UPDATE:

- H --> K
- K --> H
- T --> X
- H or K --> D
- T --> T

If a transfer procedure is submitted, it is initiated when the exit
call ends.

When the EXIT task is called without any request for change to the related
catalog entryâ€™s state, the end-of-transfer procedure is submitted according
to standard {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} rules.

When the EXIT task initiates a change of state, the procedure submission
rule depends on the final state of the catalog entry returned by the EXIT.

The following
table shows the transfer possible changes of state.


| Change of state  | End of transfer procedure submitted  |
| --- | --- |
| H to K  | Abnormal end of transfer procedure  |
| K to H  | Abnormal end of transfer procedure  |
| T to X  | No call  |
| H to D  | No call  |
| K to D  | No call  |
| T to T  | Normal end of transfer procedure  |
