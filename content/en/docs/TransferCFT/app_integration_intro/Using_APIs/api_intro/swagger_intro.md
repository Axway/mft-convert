The Swagger UI is both documentation and a client for the REST API. Each supported API command provides a detailed description, including possible parameters.

Swagger builds the HTTP frames and sends them to the REST server. However, before sending a command you must provide credentials.

Authorization
-------------

****Basic authorization****

Enter your {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} login name and password in the **Username/Password** fields. Click **Authorize**.

****Bearer authorization****

Copy your token from the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentLongName  >}} UI ****My Access Tokens**** page into the ****Value**** field and click Authorize. Click **Authorize**.
