## Use case examples

### Configure the connection

### Including subdirectories

espect the same behavior than the classic functionnally with classic files systems.

The UCONF parameter cft.dirdepth impacts the behavior:

* yes (default value), CFT + Group of files take all subdirectories in the transfer operation
* no , CFT + Group of files don't take subdirectories in the transfer operation

### The Transfer CFT stores a received file on Microsoft ABS

Transfer CFT  receives a file from a partner over the PeSIT protocol and stores it on Microsoft ABS.

 

Configure the CFTRECV object to write to the ABS:

```
CFTRECV
```

After the partner sends a file, you can check the log for transfer details.

### Transfer CFT reads a file from ABS and sends it to a partner

Here, Transfer CFT reads a file from ABS and sends it over PeSIT to a partner.

 

Create the CFTSEND template, and send a file that ABS to a Transfer CFT partner.

```
CFTSEND id=G
```

After sending a file to the partner, you can check the log for transfer details.

This section provides information on how to troubleshoot errors that you may encounter when implementing ABS with Transfer CFT.
