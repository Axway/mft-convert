You can configure  post-transfer, file renaming on the receiver side of a flow. The file is renamed on transfer completion, in the post processing phase, and includes a configurable retry mechanism.

****Limitation****

- When using a group of files in homogeneous mode, you cannot use post-transfer file renaming.

## How to configure

To enable the renaming option for a given flow (CFTRECV) set FACTION to RETRYRENAME.

**Example**

```
CFTRECV ID=SPOOLOUT, WFNAME=pub/&IDTU.TMP,
FNAME=pub/MYFILE,
FACTION=RETRYRENAME
```

Use the following uconf parameters to customize the retry mechanism.


| Parameter  | Default  | Value  | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cft.server.transfer.rrename.retry_delay  | 60 seconds  | 1-65535  | Delay in seconds between two retries for renaming.<br/> If the file is not successfully renamed after the first retry_delay, the time is compounded so that the next retry occurs at the retry time added to the number of tries multiplied by the retry value.<br/> The time of the next retry = D + D * (R-1)<br/> Where:<br/> • D is the retry_delay<br/> • R is the number of retries<br/> For example, if the file is not renamed after 60 seconds (default value), the next retry occurs in 120 seconds, and the following one in 180 seconds, etc. |
| cft.server.transfer.rrename.max_retries  | 10  | 1-65535  | Maximum number of retries.  |


### Monitoring

<span class="bold_in_para">****Log****</span>

Following a successful renaming, <span class="code">`CFTF33I `</span>is displayed.

Once the maximum number of retries is reached, the transfer moves to the YK state, and displays a DIAGI=156, <span class="code">`DIAGP=RETRYRENAME`</span>, a DIAGC=<span class="code">`RETRYRENAME MAX RETRIES REACHED`</span> or = `RETRYRENAME WFNAME NOT FOUND`, and the log messages [CFTF32E](../../troubleshoot_intro/messages_and_error_codes_start_here/cftf_messages#CFTF32E) and [CFTF34E](../../troubleshoot_intro/messages_and_error_codes_start_here/cftf_messages#CFTF34E).

****Catalog****

Information in the catalog displays the number of retries performed.

## Work flow

The retry and rename (R) option falls between the (T) and (Y) phase.

## Queuing

If you have several transfers with RETRYRENAME set for the same FNAME in a single flow, the transfers are queued based on their date/time of the end-of-transfer (DATEE, TIMEE).

## Example of spooling and renaming files

This example combines the use of the serialization with the rename/retry mechanism to ensure a spooling of file transfers without overwriting an un-consumed file at the destination.

- Our user defines a transfer flow, for example `DailyReport,`based on a transfer state (acknowledgement) using the serialization option.
- Several applications generate files that use the same flow, <span class="code">`DailyReport`</span>; these file transfer requests are queued.
- The source Transfer CFT for the flow executes the first file transfer request, <span class="code">`Report1`</span>.  
- The target Transfer CFT receives <span class="code">`Report1`</span>.
- Post-processing makes the file available to a target application, and immediately sends an acknowledgment to the source. This enables the next file transfer in the queue to be executed.
- Upon receiving the acknowledgement, the source Transfer CFT executes the next transfer request. However:

> -   If the file no longer exists on the target (it was consumed by a target application), the cycle repeats as above.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   If the file still exists on the target Transfer CFT, then the next new file transfer (<span class="code">`Report2`</span>) enters a retry cycle while it waits for the previous file to be deleted (moved/copied).

### Example configuration

#### Create models

Create a sender side model:

```
CFTSEND id=DailyReports, serial=X, ackstate=require
```

Create a receiver side model:

```
CFTRECV id=DailyReport, faction=retryrename, wfname=pub/&idtu.tmp, fname=pub/MyReport, exec=exec/
myreport.cmd
```

#### Define post-processing

Post-processing should include an acknowledgement so that the next queued transfer request is triggered. Additionally, your post-processing script can include, for example, a message to indicate that the file has been received and renamed, and is ready to be consumed by the target application.

```
end part=&part,idt=&idt,istate=yes,diagc='READY TO CONSUME'
send part=&part,idm=ACK,idt=&idt,type=reply,msg='&fname ready to consume by target application'
...[at this point the file is consumed by the target application]...
end part=&part,idt=&idt,istate=no,diagc='FILE CONSUMED'
```

#### Enter command to send files

```
send part=paris, idf=dailyreport, ida=report1
send part=paris, idf=dailyreport, ida=report2
send part=paris, idf=dailyreport, ida=report3
```

#### Check output files
