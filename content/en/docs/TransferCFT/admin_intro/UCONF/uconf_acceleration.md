About transfer acceleration
---------------------------

**UNIX/Windows only**

The {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} acceleration feature offers significantly faster transfer rates for large-file transfers, traveling long-distances over high bandwidth networks.

{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} achieves this transfer acceleration using two methods:

- UDT: a UDP-based protocol (User Datagram Protocol)
- pTCP: parallel TCP, which uses multiple parallel connections

### UDT description

UDT is a transport protocol that {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} can use to manage applications over high-speed networks. UDT uses UDP, a lower layer message, to transfer bulk data.

Configuring accelerated communication
-------------------------------------

To enable accelerated communication in CFTUTIL use the unified configuration command `UCONFSET`.

### Basic configuration

You can globally enable or disable the acceleration function in the {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} unified configuration. Next, indicate the network resources that you want to have accelerated by UDT and pTCP.

#### Parameters


| Parameter  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| acceleration.enable  | Activate/deactivate the acceleration option.  |
| acceleration.udt  | UDT default peer definition.  |
| acceleration.ptcp  | pTCP default peer definition.  |


#### Example in CFTUTIL

```
CFTUTIL UCONFSET ID=acceleration.enable, VALUE=yes  
CFTUTIL UCONFSET ID=acceleration.udt ,    VALUE=NET1  
CFTUTIL UCONFSET ID=acceleration.ptcp ,   VALUE=NET0 NET_TEST
```

In this example, all protocols (CFTPROT objects) using NET1 are accelerated by UDT, and those using NET0 and NET_TEST are accelerated by pTCP.

Network resources that are scheduled to use acceleration functionality should have their own class number in order to avoid conflicts with other network resources, one for UDT and another for pTCP. In example above, NET1 could have a class number of 4, and NET0 and NET_TEST could have a class number of 5. Additionally, partners using these network resources should also have the same class number as corresponding NET.

**Example**

```
CFTNET ID=NET0,CLASS=4,...
CFTNET ID=NET1,CLASS=5,...
 
CFTPROT ID=PESITANY,TYPE=PESIT,NET=NET1,SAP=1761,...
CFTPROT ID=PESITSSL,TYPE=PESIT,NET=NET0,SAP=1762,SSL=SSLSERVER,...
 
CFTPART ID=PART1,PROT=PESITANY,sap=part1_remote_sap...
CFTTCP ID=PART1,host=@part1,CLASS=5,...
 
CFTPART ID=PART0,PROT=PESITSSL,sap=part0_remote_sap...
CFTTCP ID=PART0,host=@part0,CLASS=4,...
 
CFTPART ID=PART2,PROT=PESITANY,sap=part2_remote_sap...
CFTTCP ID=PART2,host=@part2,CLASS=1,...
 
```

**Results**

```
CFTUTIL SEND PART=PART1,IDF=T1 will execute a transfer using "PESIT ANY" protocol and UDT network protocol
CFTUTIL SEND PART=PART0,IDF=T2 will execute a transfer using "PESIT ANY" protocol with SSL and PTCP network protocol
CFTUTIL SEND PART=PART2,IDF=T3 will fail with the following message : "CFTT11E PART=PART2 PROT=PESITANY
CLASS=5 _ CFTTCP not found"
```

### Advanced configuration parameters

Additional attribute parameters are available for advanced users. The default values should be adequate for most use cases. The following example shows a configuration for the unified configuration dictionary.

#### UDT parameters

Refer to the [UCONF parameters](../uconf_directory) table `acceleration.udt.<logicalID>`.

#### pTCP parameters

Refer to the [UCONF parameters](../uconf_directory) table `acceleration.ptcp.<logicalID>`.

> **Note**
>
> Note: Transfer CFT versions that use the newer pTCP protocol cannot perform pTCP exchanges with Transfer CFTs using the earlier pTCP version. See Protocols and networks for more information.

pTCP protocol versions
----------------------

{{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 3.0.1 SP2 and higher, and {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 2.7.1 SP6, support a more recent version of the pTCP protocol than previously supported by {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}. This newer version of pTCP offers the following advantages:

- Multi-node architecture support
- Exchange capability with Axway SecureTransport

Note that the new pTCP support is ****not**** compatible with the previously used version of pTCP. This means that {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 3.0.1 SP2 and higher, and {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} 2.7.1 SP6, ****cannot**** exchange files with earlier versions of {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} using the pTCP protocol.

For more information on supported platforms and transfer acceleration, refer to [Platform-specific functionality]().
