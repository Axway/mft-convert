| Key element | Originating versions  | Updated versions  | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API and Exits  | all versions  | to any version  | You must recompile any API or Exit programs that are used by Transfer CFT.  |
| Configuration cache feature<br/> (cft.server.parm.cache_size) | Lower than 3.8  | 3.8 and higher  | <span id="parmcache"></span>The default value is now 5000 instead of zero, making the cache feature active by default.<br/> This means that updates no longer occur dynamically; you can execute <span ><code>RECONFIG </code></span>type<span ><code>=PARMCACHE </code></span>or wait for a cache timeout as defined in <span ><code>cft.server.parm.cache_timeout (60 seconds).</code></span> |
| cft.listcat_compat = No<br/> cft.state_compat = No | Lower than 3.8  | 3.8 and higher  | Modified the default value for the <span ><code>cft.listcat_compat </code></span>(lstcompat) and <span ><code> cft.state_compat </code></span>(stacompat) parameters from YES to NO. |
| Amazon S3  | Lower than 3.8  | 3.8 and higher  | When using Amazon S3, the default setting FACTION=VERIFY is no longer ignored.<br/> If you would like to continue to have the same behavior of overwriting the file, please use FACTION=DELETE. Note, though, that the file is not available during the transfer. |
| CFTUIPREF  | Lower than 3.8  | 3.8 and higher  | After an upgrade you may need to check user privileges for creating filters in the CFTUIPREF object.  |
| Copilot Java applet  | Lower than 3.8  | 3.8 and higher  | The Copilot Java applet was removed from the product. Users are invited to use the Transfer CFT UI or Flow Manager for a graphical UI experience.  |
| SQLite database  | 3.7 and lower  | 3.8 and higher  | The CFTPARM object's PARTFNAM and PKIFNAME fields are obsolete for Windows, UNIX, and HP NonStop. |
| FTYPE=T<br/> *Windows only* | 3.2.4 to 3.7 without appropriate patch or SP*  | 3.8 and higher  | On Windows systems, note the following difference when FTYPE=T.<br/> • For versions 3.2.4 to 3.7 without the patch, an empty line terminated by a 1A character is transmitted.<br/> • Prior to 3.2.4 and for the versions with the SP or patch applied, an empty line terminated by a 1A character is not transmitted.<br/> *3.7 SP1 (patch), 3.3.2 SP8, 3.6 SP3, 3.8 |
| Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2019 &lt;/td&gt;  | 3.6 and lower  | 3.7 and higher  | Transfer CFT on Windows requires the **Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2019** for proper functioning. This provides the necessary library files (DLL) for Transfer CFT.<br/> You must install <code>vcredist_x64.exe</code> prior to installing or upgrading Transfer CFT.<br/> **Issue**<br/> If you perform an upgrade without first installing the Redistributable package, the runtime is not imported and Transfer CFT will not operate correctly. The following information displays in the <code>&lt;installdir&gt;/install.log</code> file:<br/> <code>Script stderr:</code><br/> <code>child killed: unknown signal</code><br/> <code> </code><br/> <code>Fail to import RUNTIME data.</code><br/> <code>Problem running post-install step. Installation may not complete correctly</code><br/> <code>Fail to import RUNTIME data.</code><br/> **Corrective action**<br/> • Install the Redistributable package.<br/> • From the <span ><code>cmd </code></span>console, load the profile.<br/> • Import the runtime data by running the import command to complete the upgrade.<br/> • Check that the script executed correctly. |
| LISTPKI  | 3.6 and lower  | 3.7 and higher  | To use the new LISTPKI format, copy the <code>dspcnf.xml</code> model file from <code>&lt;installdir&gt;/distrib/template/conf</code> to the <code>&lt;runtimedir&gt;/conf.</code>  |
| CFTACCNT  | 3.5 and lower  | 3.6 and higher  | Updated the documentation for the account file in v24 format. Please note the changes in field length as described in the CFTACCNT list. |
| SORTBY  | 3.5 and lower  | 3.6 and higher  | Catalog records are no longer displayed by IDTU. To have the same display as in previous versions, use the SORTBY parameter as follows:<br /> <code>listcat sortby=idtu</code> |
| EBICS  | 3.5 and lower  | 3.6 and higher  | Use the Axway EBICS client. Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.axway.com/bundle/EBICSClient_10_allOS_en_HTML5/page/ebics_client_documentation_home.html">EBICS client documentation</a> for product details. |
| BUFSIZE<br/> FBUFSIZE | 3.3.2 and lower<br/> *Unix and IBM i only* | 3.4, 3.6 SP2 and lower, 3.7 and 3.8 | A BUFSIZE or FBUFSIZE value greater than 32 kiB may lead to Transfer CFT failing to exchange messages between CFTTPRO and CFTTFIL. If you have set a value higher than 32 kiB, please decrease it to 32768.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> As of 3.6 SP3, 3.8 SP1, and 3.9, the internal value limit is 32768.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| PKIFNAME  | 3.4 and lower  | 3.5 and higher  | You can no longer reference a certificate with the PKIFNAME format (<span ><code>CFTPARM:PKIFNAME=TXT://certificate</code></span>). Previously, when implementing an integrated PKI, the PKIFNAME parameter could indicate a flat-file database (<span ><code>PKIFNAME=TXT://certificate</code></span>). If you were using this kind of file and then migrate, you must manually import all certificates into the PKI database. |
| CFTCRON  | Lower than 3.4  | 3.4 and higher  | An upgrade from a version lower than Transfer CFT 3.4 to 3.4 or higher may fail due to an incorrect time syntax because the CFTCRON time syntax is checked when creating or editing a CFTCRON object.  |
| PKIPASSW  | 3.3.2 or lower  | 3.4 and higher  | Removed the PKIPASSW parameter from PKI commands (still available for CFTPARM).<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> In earlier versions of Transfer CFT, the PKIPASSW parameter was used for encryption in the multiple PKI commands. This functionality is now replaced by the UCONF crypto.key_fname parameter.<br/> </blockquote> <span >****Impact****</span><br/> If you are using PKIEXT to export keys during a manual migration, you must use the same PKIPASSW (CFTPARM object) as was originally used to import the key. Using the same logic, to re-import a key that you extracted using PKIEXT, you require the same CFTPARM <a href="../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/pkipassw">PKIPASSW</a>.<br/> For information on exporting keys, please refer to <a href="../../transport_security_start_here/certificates/pkiutil_cli_intro/pkiext">Using PKIEXT</a>. |
| 32-bit releases  | 3.3.2 and lower  | 3.4 and higher  | End of 32-bit version deliveries.  |
| Some default values  | 3.3.2 and lower  | 3.4 and higher  |   |
| cft.server.processing_scripts_variables_blacklist  | 3.3.2 SP3 and lower  | 3.3.2 SP4 and higher  | POSIX Regular Extended expression that defines forbidden characters.  |
| TLS  | 3.2.x and higher  | not applicable | When migrating to 3.2.x or higher, SSL transfers may fail with a DIAGP e105s86 or e75s89 when performing transfers with the versions listed below (with the error occurring on the remote {{&lt; TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName &gt;}}).<br/> Affected versions:<br/> • All 3.1.3 SP7 and lower<br/> • All 3.0.1 SP3 and lower<br/> On even older versions, we recommend setting the CFTPROT:CONCAT parameter to No. |
| CA certificate chains  | 3.1.3 and lower  | 3.2.2 and higher  | In {{&lt; TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName &gt;}} 3.1.3 and lower, you can perform a SSL transfer even if the certificate chain is not complete (not signed by a ROOT CA).<br/> **Impact**<br/> In {{&lt; TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName &gt;}} 3.2.2 and higher, the certificate chain must be complete for a transfer to succeed.<br/> For more information, see <a href="../../troubleshoot_intro/admin_troubleshooting_server/troubleshoot_security#Unknown" >Unknown CA leads to a failed certificate verification</a> |
| PKIPASSW  | 3.1.3 and lower  | 3.3.2 and higher  | When upgrading from 3.1.3 to 3.3.2, first check that the PKIPASSW length value is not greater than 8 characters.<br/> If the value is 8 or less, you can proceed with the upgrade.<br/> If the PKIPASSW value in the CFTPARM command is greater than 8 characters, perform the steps in the solution below.<br/> <span >****Solution**** </span><br/> Prior to migration you must truncate the password on the Transfer CFT 3.1.3:<br/> • Export the CFTPARM.<br /> <code>CFTUTIL cftext type=parm, fout=file_parm.out</code><br/> • Modify the PKIPASSW in the file. For example, if the old value was <span ><code>PKIPASSW=12345678910</code></span>, replace it with <span ><code>PKIPASSW=12345678.</code></span><br/> • Reimport:<br /> <span ><code>CFTUTIL config type=input,fname=file_parm.out</code></span><br/> • Continue the Transfer CFT 3.3.2 upgrade process. |
| Copilot client  | 3.1.3 or lower | 3.2.2 and higher  | The Copilot application changed from a Java applet to a Java Web Start program.<br/> <span >****Impact****</span><br/> Copilot requires Java 7 or higher. |
| ROOTCID=NONE  | 3.1.3  | 3.2.2 and higher  | Non authentication method was available in 3.1.3 and lower (anonymous TLS connection).<br/> <span >****Impact****</span><br/> This support has been removed in {{&lt; TransferCFT/suitevariablesTransferCFTName &gt;}} 3.2.2 and higher. You must update the ROOTCID parameter. |
| TLS  | 3.1.3 or lower  | 3.2.2 and higher  | To comply with security standards, as of Transfer CFT version 3.2.2 the use of the cipher suites 59, 60, and 61 is restricted to TLS 1.2 exclusively.<br/> <span >****Impact****</span><br/> This means that if some of your partners use a version of Transfer CFT lower than 3.2.2 that does not support TLS 1.2, and you are using ciphers 59, 60 and 61, which requires TLS 1.2 in version 3.2.2 and higher, you must add another cipher in the cipher list and remove ciphers 59, 60, 61 from the partner's cipher list.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> You do not have to remove ciphers 59, 60, 61 in the partner cipher list if you apply the Transfer CFT patch 3.0.1 SP11.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| Rotate the log  | 3.0.1 or lower  | 3.1.3 and higher  | Changed the switch log feature behavior.<br/> In version 3.0.1 or lower, there were two files that automatically alternated.<br/> <span >****Impact****</span><br/> In version 3.1.3 and higher if you want to continue this functionality, you must set the alternate log file's uconf value <span ><code>cft.cftlog.afname</code></span> to the alternate file path (for example, <span ><code>$CFTRUNTIME/log/cftloga</code></span>). |
| Demo certificates  | 3.0.1 or lower  | 3.1.2 and higher  | Axway no longer delivers the template certificates used in the Transfer CFT SSL.<br/> ****Impact****<br/> If you were using the demo certificates, import your proper certificates and replace in the PKI database as the Demo certificates are expired. |
| CFTPARM <br/> key parameter | 2.7.1 or lower  | 3.0.1 and higher  | If you had the CFTPARM key parameter set directly to a value, you must modify this so that key parameter points to an indirection file containing the license key.  |

SAF checking applies only if Transfer CFT is running APF authorized.<br/> • MONITOR: The USERID associated with the monitor is always used.<br/> *See Note. |
| PDSESHARING [ <u>NO</u> | YES]  |  • NO (default) = Do not allow others to write to PDSE in sharing mode.<br/> • YES = Allow simultaneous writing to a PDSE file type. Other intervening applications must also use the shared mode option though for sharing to occur.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> On a shared SYSPLEX you must customize the following z/OS system parameter, either:<br/> </blockquote> • NORMAL: SYSn.PARMLIB member IGDSMSxx to specify PDSESHARING, or<br/> • EXTENDED: SYSn.PARMLIB member IGDSMSxx to specify PDSESHARING<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> The delivered sample uses the value ‘PDSESHARING=YES’.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| [ROUTCDE = {Value of the ROUTCODE CODE field of the WTO | n}] | The left bit corresponds to 1. The right bit corresponds to 16. The default value ROUTCDE=X‘0008’ corresponds to ROUTCDE=(13).<br/> This value is used with the ‘OPERMSG’ option of the ‘CFTLOG’ parameter.<br/> For the options DESC and ROUTCE, refer to the IBM document Supervisor services and macros, which explains the use of DESCRIPTOR CODES and ROUTCODES. |
| [SDSFOPT = { <u>USER</u> | MONITOR | IGNORE}]  | How Transfer CFT processes a MODIFY command issued from SDSF:<br/> • USER (default value): the console name defined in SDSF options is used as the user id issuing the command.<br/> • MONITOR: the USERID associated with the monitor is used.<br/> • IGNORE: MODIFY commands issued from SDSF are ignored.<br/> *See Note. |
| [SHARECAT = { **YES** | NO | INACT }] |  • YES (default value): The catalog is cached in a common dataspace that is shared with the Copilot user interface, the CFTUTIL utility, and so on. This parameter improves catalog reading, especially from the Copilot user interface, when enabled.<br/> QQQ_QQQ_QQQ_LIST<br/> • If the catalog is full and an extension is created (using either the <span ><code>cft.cftcat.auto_expand_*</code></span> parameters or <span ><code>RECONFIG TYPE=CAT</code></span>), new records are stored in the extension and not in the cache. Accessing records in the extension may negatively impact performance.<br/><br/> • Do not use YES when implementing a multi-node architecture.<br/> <br/> • NO: The catalog is cached in a dataspace, but the dataspace is not shared.<br/> • INACT: The catalog is not cached, and no dataspace is created.<br/> NO: The catalog is cached in a dataspace, but the dataspace is not shared.<br/> INACT: The catalog is not cached, and no dataspace is created.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> When the Transfer CFT is an APF-authorized program (Authorized Program Facility), specify if the catalog dataspace cache is available to be read by other Transfer CFT applications.<br/> </blockquote> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> The delivered sample uses the value ‘SHARECAT=YES’.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| [SGTRACE = {0 | n}] {1…65535} | Initial value of the SGTRACE trace file.<br/> A value other than 0 may be used if requested by Transfer CFT customer support.<br/> Possible combinations are:<br/> • 1: Network actions (TCP)<br/> • 2: Erroneous actions<br/> • 4: File manager actions<br/> • 8: Read/write to files<br/> • 16: C functions<br/> • 32: Long messages<br/> • 64: Inter-task communication actions<br/> • 128: Program calls and return messages<br/> • 256: Interactive interface actions<br/> • 512: User exit calls<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> When you use the SGTRACE options with the Transfer CFT interface under VTAM, the non-encrypted passwords are listed in the trace records.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| [SUBOPT = { 0 | 1 | 3 } ]  | Manages 2 statistic lines for a job submitted by Transfer CFT:<br/> • 0: Default. Generates 2 lines at the end of JCL //* SUBMITTED BY:jobname AT DD/MM/YY hh:mm:ss ,USERID=username ,CARDS= 0000000 // .<br/> • 1: Generates only the statistic line at the end of the JCL and no card ‘//’ //* SUBMITTED BY:jobname AT DD/MM/YY hh:mm:ss ,USERID=username ,CARDS= 0000000 .<br/> • 3: Does not generate a line at the end of the JCL. |
| [TRACE = { <u>128</u> | n}] {4…16383} | Transfer CFT internal trace size (in Kb). |
| [TAPE = {NOTSUP | <u>UPDATE</u> | OUTPUT}] |  • NOTSUP: Forbids access to tape files for all Transfer CFT programs.<br/> • UPDATE: Default. Enables writing of tape files protected by means of a retaining date or tape library management software.<br/> • OUPUT: The transfer fails in ABDEND 713 if the tape is write-protected by tape library management software, or an expiration date.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> The delivered sample uses the value ‘TAPE=OUTPUT’.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| [TSOEDIT = { <u>NO</u> | YES}] | File support with sequence number in columns 73 to 80:<br/> • YES: If the ISPF editor with the ‘NUMBER ON’ option creates them, then the input files read by CFTUTIL can contain an eight-digit sequence number in columns 73 to 80. This sequence number is then ignored by Transfer CFT z/OS.<br/> • NO: Input files are read without changes from CFTUTIL.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> The delivered sample uses the value ‘TSOEDIT=YES’.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| [VSAMSUFS = { <u>SHORT</u> | LONG }]  |  • SHORT: VSAM component suffixes are created with .D for KSDS and ESDS, and .I for KSDS.<br/> • LONG: VSAM component suffixes are created with .DATA for KSDS and ESDS, and .INDEX for KSDS.<br/> Alternatively, you can set this parameter using: <span ><code>UCONFSET ID=cft.mvs.sginstal.vsamsufs,value=x</code></span> |

| Step  | Task  |
| --- | --- |
| 1  | If you have not done so, customize <a href="">MNINIT</a>.  |
| 2  | Customize the UPARM(TC*) members.<br/> The example (below) demonstrates how to customize LPAR1 and LPAR2. If you have additional machines in your configuration, repeat this step for each host machine. For a single host installation, you only customize UPARM(TCPSHAP1). |
| 3  | Perform a Transfer CFT configuration check:<br/> • Verify that the CFTNET object host parameter corresponds with what you defined for the VIPA.<br/> • Verify that the CFTNET command SRCPORT parameter is set to 1. |
| 4  | Submit the MNINIT. The Transfer CFT is now configured for multi-node.  |
|   | Steps 5 and 6, which use the VARY OBEYFILE commands, require administrator rights.  |
| 5  | Execute the VARY OBEYFILE command for each UPARM(TC*) member.  |
| 6  | For a z/OS restart, the administrator must do all of the VIPA OBEYFILE commands performed in Step 5 on the z/OS machine.  |

| CID = string | Unique local identifier of the certificate to be created, replaced or deleted. |
| --- | --- |
| [CHECK = YES | NO] | Certificate check during import: this option is only applicable for a user or intermediate authority certificate.<br/> A check is performed:<br/> • To establish whether the root or intermediate authority certificate exists in the local database<br/> • On the certificate signature<br/> • To determine whether the public key matches the private key (if the private key is to be imported) |
| [COMMENT = string1..64] | Comment associated with the certificate: for the CREATE or REPLACE operations only. |
| IDATA  | Source as base64 or PEM data instead of a file. If you use PKIUTIL IDATA, you cannot also use INAME, and vice versa.  |
| IKDATA  | Source as base64 or PEM data instead of a file. If you use PKIUTIL IKDATA, you cannot also use IKNAME, and vice versa. |
| [IFORM = PKCS12 | DER | PEM | PKCS7] | Format of the certificate to be imported. It must be specified if the INAME parameter is set. |
| [IKFORM = PKCS8 | DER | PEM ] | Format of the private key to be imported. This parameter must be specified if the IKNAME parameter is set. *only in command line* |
| [IKNAME = string1..64] | File from which the private key, which is associated with a user certificate, to be imported or updated must be read.<br/> • This parameter is not significant if the certificate format is PKCS#12 as the certificate and private key are declared in the same source file.<br/> • If you call PKIUTIL with IKDATA, you cannot use IKNAME. |
| [IKPASSW = string1..64] | Source file protection password. This is the source file protection password, and must be specified for encrypted PEM (PKCS#5), PKCS#8 encrypted private key formats, PKCS#7, or for PKCS#12 certificate formats.<br/> There are two ways to specify the password:<br/> • By value: the value assigned to the parameter is used directly as a password<br/> • By reference to a file: the value assigned to the parameter is the name of a file, the first record of which contains the password; in this case, the file name must be preceded by a # or @ sign depending on the OS. On Windows, for example, IKPASSW=#myfile where the password is specified in the <span ><code>myfile </code></span>file; the first file record must contain the password in plain format. |
| [INAME = string1..128] | Source file containing the certificate to be imported or updated.<br/> • This parameter is not allowed in DELETE mode.<br/> • If you call PKIUTIL with IDATA, you cannot use INAME. |
| [ITYPE = ALL | USER | ROOT | INTER] | Type of certificate to be imported.<br/> This parameter is mandatory for the modes DELETE (deleting a certificate from the database) and REPLACE (updating a certificate).<br/> This field must be specified for an X.509 certificate, Version 1 or 2. The type of an X.509 version 3 certificate is determined automatically. For version 3, the ITYPE parameter is matched against the type detected:<br/> • ALL: certificate type not checked *only in command line*<br/> • USER: user certificate<br/> • ROOT: root authority certificate<br/> • INTER: intermediate authority certificate |
| [MODE = REPLACE | CREATE | DELETE] | Action on the certificate. The REPLACE action imports or updates an existing certificate in the database.<br/> If importing a certificate chain, user certificate and all intermediate authority certificates, all certificates are recorded in the local database. The user certificate is recorded with the identifier generated from the ID parameter. Intermediate authority certificates are recorded with internal identifiers in the local internal datafile and cannot be viewed. *only in command line* |
| [PASSWORD]  | If you use a password, the PKICER certificate is exported in PKCS#12 format (rather than KPRIV).<br/> *Only available in command line* |
| [ROOTCID = string1..8] | This parameter is mandatory for the DELETE (deletion of a certificate from the database) and REPLACE (update of a certificate) modes. It indicates the identifier of the authority of the certificate to be deleted or updated.<br/> This parameter must even be indicated for an authority certificate. In this case, the ID and ROOTCID parameters have the same value. *Only mandatory for DELETE and REPLACE in command line* |
| [STATE = ACT | INACT] | Status of the imported certificate.<br/> By default, the certificate is active and can be used by Transfer CFT. |

| <a href="../../../command_summary/parameter_intro/id">ID</a> | Name identifying the partner.<br/> This value makes reference to a partner description (CFTPART ID = ...).<br/> When ID is set to the CFTPARM command DEFAULT parameter value, the command describes the default network configuration of a calling partner (hence operation in SERVER mode if the partner is only a REQUESTER). In this case, the parameters specific to a partner and the parameters specific to outgoing calls (DIALNO, CNXOUT, RETRY*, O*TIME) are not applicable. |

| ****Parameter**** | ****Description**** |
| --- | --- |
| CONTENT  | Filter to use on the messages written in the active LOG file.  |
| DATETIMEMAX  | Use to display catalog transfers that happened on or before this end date and time according to the transfer record creation (DATEK, TIMEK).  |
| DATETIMEMIN  | Use to display catalog transfers that happened on or after this start date and time according to the transfer record creation (DATED, TIMED).  |
| DIAGI  | Define the diagi catalog transfer field display:<br/> • DIAGI=0: select transfers that have a DIAGI=0<br/> • DIAGI=ERROR: select transfers that have a DIAGI other than 0<br/> • DIAGI=* : select all transfers (default value) |
| DIRECT  | Transfer direction of the requests.  |
| EMPTY | Use this parameter to replace the default output of <span >****Empty****</span> values, usually empty string values.<br/> The default string <span >****ANY****</span> means that EMPTY is specified in the model. The default EMPTY used is '-' if it is not defined in the model. |
| FILE  | Enter file name  |
| FMODEL | Complete name or logical name of the XML model file.<br/> This parameter default value is fixed.  |
| FOUT  | <span >****PeSIT****</span> You can extract Transfer CFT messages from the Catalog file, and forward these messages to a specified file using the fout parameter.<br/> The message length for PeSIT ANY profile, when forwarding a message from one CFT to another, has increased from 512 to 4096 bytes. The S/RRUSIZE must be greater than the maximum message length and message information combined (for example, 4127).<br/> The fout parameter enables you to redirect output to a specified file. |
| HELP | Displays help information:<br/> • FIELDS: Output all the fields name available for display model creation<br/> • MODELS: Output all the models available in the current model file |
| IDA  | Local transfer identifier assigned by the user or user application. This identifier may be a search criterion for the catalog entry asso  |
| IDF  | File type identifier.  |
| IDT  | Transfer identifier. Identifies a transfer for a given partner and transfer direction.  |
| IDTU  | Catalog identifier. It is a unique, local reference to a transfer.  |
| MODE | This parameter is used to force a model's output mode.<br/> Two modes are available:<br/> • COLUMN: This mode outputs the catalog fields in columns with a title bar (see <a href="../brief_catalog_listing">LISTCAT CONTENT=BRIEF</a>).<br/> • LINE: This mode outputs the catalog fields with one field per line prefixed by its title.<br/> The default value ANY means that the mode is specified in the model. The default mode COLUMN is used if not defined in the model either. |
| NA | Use this parameter to replace the default output of "Non Applicable" values. <br/> A Non Applicable value is a value that does not mean anything for the concerned transfer. For instance, the message content field doesn't mean anything for a file transfer, so the NA string will be displayed instead.<br/> The default string 'ANY' means that the NA is specified in the model. The default NA used will be '#' if not defined in the model either. |
| NPART  | Network name of the transfer partner.  |
| PART  | The local identifier for the site where the monitor runs.  |
| PHASE  | Refers to the highest level in the transfer flow cycle, for example X (done).  |
| PHASESTEP  | The processing phase step.  |
| PIDTU  | The parent idtu is the idtu of the generic transfer. This means that for a group of files, file collection, or for broadcasting, the child transfers are now linked to the parent via the PIDTU.  |
| RUSER | Displays value as defined in the CONTENT parameter. |
| SORTBY  | Use this parameter to display information in an alphabetical/alphanumberic order.<br/> For example, to sort by partner name and identifier, enter:<br/> <span ><code>CFTUTIL DISPLAY SORTBY=(PART,IDF)</code></span><br/> Additionally, you can add a prefix to define the criteria direction. Use <span ><code>+</code></span> to increase (default) or <span ><code>-</code></span> to decrease. For example:<br/> <code>CFTUTIL DISPLAY SORTBY=(-IDTU)</code> |
| STATE  | Defines the transfer request state.  |
| SUSER | Displays value as defined in the CONTENT parameter. |
| TYPE  | Defines the concerned type (object, medium, etc.).  |

| Certificate field  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Version  | The version of the encoded certificate value for X509v3 is 2.  |
| Serial Number  | An integer assigned by the CA. The issuer name and serial number must identify a unique certificate.  |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm  | The signature algorithm identifier used by the CA to sign the certificate (e.g., RSA with SHA-1).  |
| Issuer Distinguished Name | The DN of the entity who has signed and issued the certificate.  |
| Validity Period  | The dates on which the certificate becomes valid and on which the certificate ceases to be valid.  |
| Subject Distinguished Name  | The entity associated with the public key stored in the subject's public key field.  |
| Subject Public Key Information  | The public key and identifier algorithm with which the key is used.  |
| Issuer Unique Identifier (optional)  | To prevent the reuse of issuer name over time, a unique identifier is assigned to the CA.  |
| Subject Unique Identifier (optional)  | To prevent the reuse of subject name over time, a unique identifier is assigned to the CA.  |
| Extensions (optional)  | Extensions are additional information about the certificate. Extensions consist of three fields: type, criticality, and value. Type field is the ASN.1type of the data (for example, text string, numerical, date). The criticality flag is either critical or non-critical. If PKI client application cannot process a critical extension, the certificate will be rejected. The actual value is the value associated with the extension.  |

| [PKIFNAME = string1..64]  | [PKIFNAME = string1..64] *Obsolete for Windows/Unix.*  |
| ROOTCID = string1..8 | Local identifier of the authority of the certificates to be enabled/disabled.<br/> This parameter must even be indicated for an authority certificate. In this case, the ID and ROOTCID parameters have the same value. |
| TYPE = KEY  | To activate/deactivate the PKIKEY.  |



============================== table nb count(587) ============================================


| ID = string1..32 | Unique local identifier of the certificate to be created, replaced or deleted. |
| --- | --- |
| [CHECK = YES | NO] | Certificate check during import: this option is only applicable for a user or intermediate authority certificate.<br/> A check is performed:<br/> • To establish whether the root or intermediate authority certificate exists in the local database<br/> • On the certificate signature<br/> • To determine whether the public key matches the private key (if the private key is to be imported)<br/> **Command line only** |
| [COMMENT = string1..64] | Comment associated with the certificate: for the CREATE or REPLACE operations only. |
| IDATA  | Source as base64 or PEM data instead of a file. If you use PKIUTIL IDATA, you cannot also use INAME, and vice versa.  |
| IKDATA  | Source as base64 or PEM data instead of a file. If you use PKIUTIL IKDATA, you cannot also use IKNAME, and vice versa. |
| [IFORM = PKCS12 | DER | PEM | PKCS7] | Format of the certificate to be imported. It must be specified if the INAME parameter is set. |
| [IKFORM = PKCS8 | DER | PEM ] | Format of the private key to be imported. This parameter must be specified if the IKNAME parameter is set. |
| [IKNAME = string1..64] | File from which the private key, that is associated with a user certificate, to be imported or updated must be read.<br/> • This parameter is not significant if the certificate format is PKCS#12 as the certificate and private key are declared in the same source file.<br/> • If you call PKIUTIL with IKDATA, you cannot use IKNAME. |
| [IKPASSW = string1..64] | Source file protection password. This is the source file protection password, and must be specified for encrypted PEM (PKCS#5), PKCS#8 encrypted private key formats, PKCS#7, or for PKCS#12 certificate formats.<br/> There are two ways to specify the password:<br/> • By value: the value assigned to the parameter is used directly as a password<br/> • By reference to a file: the value assigned to the parameter is the name of a file, the first record of which contains the password; in this case, the file name must be preceded by a # or @ sign depending on the OS. On Windows, for example, IKPASSW=#myfile where the password is specified in the <span ><code>myfile </code></span>file; the first file record must contain the password in plain format. |
| [INAME = string1..128] | Source file containing the certificate to be imported or updated.<br/> • This parameter is not allowed in DELETE mode.<br/> • If you call PKIUTIL with IDATA, you cannot use INAME. |
| [ITYPE = ALL | USER | ROOT | INTER] | Type of certificate to be imported.<br/> This parameter is mandatory for the modes DELETE (deleting a certificate from the database) and REPLACE (updating a certificate).<br/> This field must be specified for an X.509 certificate, Version 1 or 2. The type of an X.509 version 3 certificate is determined automatically. For version 3, the ITYPE parameter is matched against the type detected:<br/> • ALL: certificate type not checked<br/> • USER: user certificate<br/> • ROOT: root authority certificate<br/> • INTER: intermediate authority certificate |
| [MODE = REPLACE | CREATE | DELETE] | Action on the certificate. The REPLACE action imports or updates an existing certificate in the database.<br/> If importing a certificate chain, user certificate and all intermediate authority certificates, all certificates are recorded in the local database. The user certificate is recorded with the identifier generated from the ID parameter. Intermediate authority certificates are recorded with internal identifiers in the local internal datafile and cannot be viewed. |
| [PASSWORD]  | If you use a password, the PKICER certificate is exported in PKCS#12 format (rather than KPRIV).  |
| [ROOTCID = string] | This parameter is mandatory for the DELETE (deletion of a certificate from the database) and REPLACE (update of a certificate) modes. It indicates the identifier of the authority of the certificate to be deleted or updated.<br/> This parameter must even be indicated for an authority certificate. In this case, the ID and ROOTCID parameters have the same value. |
| [STATE = ACT | INACT] | Status of the imported certificate.<br/> By default, the certificate is active and can be used by Transfer CFT. |

| 200  | OK  | Everything went fine. The resource you requested has been found.  |
| 201  | Created  | Use it for synchronous processing, that is, when creating a resource synchronously. This status code goes along with the Response Location HTTP header, indicating where the new resource is accessible.  |
| 202  | Accepted  | Use it for asynchronous processing, typically for long running tasks (image processing, file compression, etc.). It indicates that the server has accepted the request but the result is not available yet. Responses usually contain a ‘task’ id the client can request (on a different URL) to get the status of a given long-running task.  |
| 400  | Bad request  | Indicates that the request is malformed. This is usually used to enforce that the requester is providing adequate parameters to the operation. For instance, if the operation requires a numerical identifier and gets a text instead, the server should return this status code.  |
| 401  | Unauthorized  | The requester provided invalid credentials. May indicate that the user and or password are not correct, or that the rights for the user are not sufficient to modify a transfer.  |
| 404  | Not found  | The resource was not found. The URL may not be correct.  |

| <span >****masc****</span>  | Mask for selecting stages<br /> This field comprises 16 bytes; each byte can take the value 0 or 1 and is associated with a stage:<br/> • Byte 0 =&gt; ALLOC_TYP<br/> • Byte 1 =&gt; OPEN_TYP<br/> • Byte 2 =&gt; TRANS_TYP<br/> • Byte 3 =&gt; DATA_TYP<br/> • Byte 4 =&gt; CHECK_TYP<br/> • Byte 5 =&gt; RESTART_TYP<br/> • Byte 6 =&gt; DTEND_TYP<br/> • Byte 7 =&gt; CLOSE_TYP<br/> • Byte 8 =&gt; ENDTR_TYP<br/> • Byte 9 =&gt; ABORT_TYP<br/> • Bytes 10 to 15 =&gt; Reserved<br/> Byte 0 always equals 1.<br/> If you set a byte to 1, it means that you want to take control during the associated stage<br /> The value of the field mtype indicates the rank of the byte associated with the stage |
| ****access **** | File access managements under the control of:<br/> • Transfer CFT if set to 0<br /> {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} takes charge of all operations; you can, however, change certain features of the file (name, size, format, etc.) at the allocation and opening stages<br/> • The user if set to 1<br /> You are responsible for all operations performed on the file: allocation, opening, read/write, closing, de-allocation |
| ****retsync**** | The return is:<br/> • 0 : synchronous<br /> The user function processes the stage and returns control to the interface.<br/> • 1: asynchronous<br /> The user function returns control to the interface before processing the stage (deferred processing). The transfer is suspended and the interface waits for an end of processing message from the user.<br/> As the user does not yet have the information or tools required to use the possibility of an asynchronous return, the return will always be synchronous  |
| ****ret1**** | Return code:<br/> • 0 = processing ok<br/> • 9 = refusal and end of transfer<br/> Other values are defined depending on the transfer stage. For more information, refer to the <a href="../using_file_exit_comm_area">Using the Communication Structure</a>. |

| --- | --- |
| ex_name | Address of an (512+1) byte area.<br/> The initialization function can modify this area. |
| idf | Address of an (32+1) byte area.<br/> This area contains the file identifier of the transfer in process. |
| parm | Address of an (64+1) byte area.<br/> This area contains the value of the PARM parameter of the CFTEXIT command and can be modified by the initialization function. |
| language | Address of a one-byte area.<br/> This area contains the value of the LANGUAGE parameter of the CFTEXIT command and can be modified by the initialization function. |
| pfonc | Address of an area that contains the address of the user function.<br/> If you want to take control, the initialization function must update this area. The idf, parm and language parameters are initialized by the interface. The idf and parm parameters can be used to select a function when the user has provided several functions.<br/> The user may use the exfref parameter as required. The contents of this parameter are thereafter provided to the user function.<br/> The (n+1) byte areas contain characters up to n bytes long followed by a binary zero. |
| Return codes | The possible values are:<br/> • 0: the user wants to take control at one stage at least<br/> • 1: the user does not want to take control |

| Parameter | Explanation |
| psCtx | Address of the interface communication area.<br/> Also known as context table or transfer context, this area is:<br/> • Allocated by the interface for each transfer<br/> • Updated by the interface before each call of the user function<br/> • Freed by the interface at the end of the transfer<br/> For simultaneous transfers using a given EXIT, the interface manages the context tables. Each transfer has its own context.<br/> Some fields of the context table can be updated by the user function. For more information, refer to the <a href="../file_exit_communication_area_">About the communication structure</a> topic.  |
| psCtxWork | Address of the user working area.<br/> This area, allocated and de-allocated by the interface for each transfer, enables users to save the information they consider necessary for the purposes of the processing performed.<br/> Its size equals the value of the RESERV parameter of the CFTEXIT object. |
| psData | Address of the data area.<br/> This area, allocated and de-allocated by the interface for each transfer, contains the record to be sent or the record received.<br/> Its size is limited to 4096 bytes.

| part  | If this field:<br/> • is empty when the user function is returned from, the partner local identifier "UNDEFPTN" appears in the catalog and on the {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} standard output.<br/> • has been modified and if the new identifier is located in the {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} partner base, {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} sets the ret1 field to 9 (processing error) and the diag field to "PTNEXIST"<br/> • has been modified, during any network or protocol connection attempts that may have been made, the system behaves as if the partner is not known to Transfer CFT |
| ipart  | If the ipart field is defined, a voluntary store and forward or backup mechanism<br /> (omintime = omaxtime) is possible.<br /> The user function is called to provide complete information or modify the intermediate partner information<br /> In the store and forward case, the commutfl field is set to 1. |
| idprot, idnet, prot and prof  | The idnet, prot and prof fields are connected to the CFTPROT command identifier (idprot). If the idprot field is modified, the new value must correspond to a CFTPROT command ( {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} updates the fields that are associated with it)<br /> If not, {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} sets the ret1 field to 9 (processing error) and the diag field to "NOPROT".<br /> <br/> The protl field indicates the list of {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} parameter setting protocols.  |
| nspart, nspassw, sap and addr  | If the nspart (and nspassw as applicable), sap and addr fields are not defined when the user function is returned from, the network and protocol connections will not be able to be established<br /> <br /> The maximum length taken into account for the remote partner address depends on the network type:<br/> • Network type = TCP : Length = 64<br/><br/>  |
| nrpart  | If the field nrpart is empty when the user function is returned from, it is set to the value of the part field.<br/> A network partner is identified by a network name (nrpart).<br/> If the user establishes simultaneous connections with several network partners using the same name, the values of the counters below will be the sum of these connections and will be the same for each partner:<br/> • curreqc: current number of transfers in requester mode, for the given network partner<br/> • cursrvc: current number of transfers in server mode, for the given network<br /> partner |
| maxrty<br /> and currty  | During network connection attempts, the currty value may be used to assign a new address to the remote partner<br /> This counter is reset to zero each time the remote partner address is changed.<br/> If the currty value reaches the maxrty value, Transfer CFT attempts to go on to the next backup address.<br /> If there are no further backup addresses, {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} attempts to go on to the next backup protocol. If there are no further backup protocols, {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} attempts to perform a backup store and forward<br/> With the directory type EXIT task in requester mode, and one and only one protocol and a single address associated with a partner, {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} attempts the backup store and forward. If the intermediate partner does not exist, the transfer changes to the K state. |
| maxrtyp and currtyp  | During protocol connection attempts, the currtyp value may be used to assign a new protocol to the remote partner<br /> The counter is reset to zero each time the protocol is changed<br/> If the currtyp value reaches the maxrtp value, Transfer CFT attempts to go on to the next backup protocol<br /> If there are no further backup protocol, the transfer changes to the K state<br/> With the directory type EXIT in requester mode, and a single protocol associated with the partner, the transfer changes to the K state  |

If the list of partners is defined in a file (FNAME parameter) the transfers carried out for the only for existing partners and the treatment is identical to that for the NOPART=CONTINUE option.<br/> • CONTINUE: If the partner does not exist, Transfer CFT indicates this in a message in the LOG.<br/> CFTT32E PART=idpart Not found. Pass the transfer in SFK diagi 408 and continue the transfers for the other partners. The generic post remains in the K state and the end of transfer procedure is not executed.<br/> • IGNORE:<br/> • If a partner does not exist in the list, Transfer CFT ignores the partner (there is no transfer) and moves on to the next partner.<br/> • A message is displayed in the LOG CFTT37I PART=idpart _ Not found and ignored for CFTDEST iddest<br/> • The generic job passes to the T state and is under the end of transfer procedure. |

In this case, the NRPART parameter is already assigned to an existing CFTPART command.<br/> • &amp;id: Non bijective table: The conversion table specified in the file referenced by the CFTXLATE DIRECT=BOTH command is not bijective (&amp;Id being the command identifier). Check that the conversion table specified is bijective or create one command for each transfer direction (DIRECT=SEND or DIRECT=RECV).<br/> • No partner found: A partner activation or deactivation command (ACT or INACT) resulted in an error. The identifier indicated (ACT ID=&amp;Part) does not correspond to an existing partner identifier (CFTPART ID=&amp;Part).<br/> • Media communication is full: A transfer command (SEND or RECV) could not be written to the {{&lt; TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName &gt;}} communication file.
