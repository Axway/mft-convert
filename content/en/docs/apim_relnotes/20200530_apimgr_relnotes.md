## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

### Updated OS Support

The operating systems CentOS 7, CentOS 8, RedHat 7, and RedHat 8 have been tested and validated.

### Improved upgrade experience

* You can use the script `update_apigw.sh` for updating API Gateway and API Manager installations, replacing the post installation script `apigw_sp_post_install.sh`. This automates some of the previous manual steps. It supports backups and can run in unattended mode. For more information about the usage of the script see the [installation steps](#installation) and the `--help` output
* Automation of some manual steps for update.
* The `update_apimanager.sh` script still required.
* The update is still applied manually to each node in the topology.
* There are [new scripts](/docs/apim_reference/scripts_changelog_sp/) to apply updates for Policy Studio and Configuration Studio.

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

<!-- Use this section to describe any changes in the behavior of the product (as a result of features or fixes), for example, new Java system properties in the jvm.xml file. This section could also be used for any important information that doesn't fit elsewhere. -->

### TLS v1.3 support

This update supports TLS v1.3 protocol for HTTPS listeners and connection filters. All communication between Node Managers, API Gateways, and other services now uses TLS v1.3 protocol by default.

### Filebeat v6.2.2

This update uses Filebeat v6.2.2. Before installing this update, you must delete the Filebeat folder  `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. When using Filebeat, follow the [official Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.6/index.html).

### OpenJDK JRE

API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 and later support OpenJDK JRE, and this update includes Zulu OpenJDK 1.8 JRE instead of Oracle JRE 1.8.

### OpenSSL and FIPS support

This update uses OpenSSL 1.1.1, as OpenSSL 1.0.2 is EOL.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not support FIPS, and running API Gateway in FIPS mode is not supported in this update. OpenSSL 3.0 (when available) will support FIPS, and FIPS support will be available again in a future update.

References to FIPS in the documentation will not be removed, but this does not mean that FIPS is still supported and the references should be ignored.

### Log4j 2 changes

The Log4j 2 version has been updated from 2.8.2 to 2.13.2. In addition, the Log4j 2 file format has been changed to YAML.

| 7.7 releases prior to May 2020                           | 7.7 May 2020 and later                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/eventLog.xml`              | `$VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/eventLog.yaml`              |
| `$VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/openTrafficLog.xml`        | `$VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/openTrafficLog.yaml`        |
| `$VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/topologyLog.xml`          | `$VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/topologyLog.yaml`          |
| `$VDISTDIR/system/conf/log4j2.xml`                       | `$VDISTDIR/system/conf/log4j2.yaml`                       |
| `$VDISTDIR/rcplatform/plugin-filter-base/lib/log4j2.xml` | `$VDISTDIR/rcplatform/plugin-filter-base/lib/log4j2.yaml` |

If you have made any customizations to these XML files you must translate them to the equivalent YAML files.

### Swagger parser

The Swagger parser libraries have been updated as follows.

| Parser                | Previous version | New version |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Swagger Legacy Parser | 1.0.48           | 1.0.50      |
| OpenAPI 3 Parser      | 2.0.16           | 2.0.19      |

## Deprecated features

<!-- Add features that are deprecated here -->

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering.

The following capabilities have been deprecated.

### Antivirus scanners

API Gateway already supports the industry standard Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). From the November 2020 update the following embedded antivirus scanners will be removed:

* McAfee
* Sophos
* Clam AV

Content scanning is still supported using the ICAP filter, which provides out-of-the-box integration with ICAP-capable servers provided by Symantec, McAfee, OPSWAT and others, promoting ease of deployment and operational control.

### Deprecated libraries

From the July 2020 update the following API Gateway libraries will be replaced by the listed artifacts under the `system/lib` folder.

| May 2020 library              | July 2020 artifact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This is a security issue as sensitive information should never be included in the URL. **Resolution**: Only a POST request with `access_token` sent in the body of the POST request are now accepted. |

### Policy Studio help documentation

This update includes changes to the Policy Studio documentation, but the version of the documentation (Eclipse Help) shipped with Policy Studio is out of sync with the online documentation and does not include these changes.

We are working to rectify this issue in a future update. In the meantime, you can find the up to date documentation online at [Develop in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/).

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

These instructions apply to API Gateway and API Manager classic deployments only. For container deployments, see [Update a container deployment](#update-a-container-deployment).

### Prerequisites

This update has the following prerequisites in addition to the [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

1. Shut down any Node Manager or API Gateway instances on your existing installation.
2. Back up your existing installation. You can use the `update_apigw.sh` script to take a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory as detailed in the [API Gateway server install steps](#install-the-api-gateway-server-update), or you can manage your own backups as detailed in [API Gateway backup and disaster recovery](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/manage_operations/#api-gateway-backup-and-disaster-recovery). Ensure that you back up any customized files. You should merge updated files instead of copying them back directly to avoid any regex matching issues, whether you manage your own backups or not. For example, the following directories might contain customized files:

   ```
   webapps/apiportal/vordel/apiportal
   webapps/emc/vordel/manager/app
   webapps/emc
   system/conf/apiportal/email
   system/conf
   samples/scripts/
   tools/filebeat-VERSION-PLATFORM
   ```
3. If you have an existing Apache Cassandra installation, ensure that you back up your data (Cassandra and `kpsadmin`), and that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly in `cassandra.in.sh` and `cassandra.in.bat`.
4. Remove the old Filebeat folder `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. Check any customized files to see if they are compatible with the new version. See [Filebeat](#filebeat-v6-2-2) for more information.
5. On Linux, remove existing capabilities on product binaries (which might prevent overwriting files):

   ```
   setcap -r INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/bin/vshell
   ```
6. Remove any subdirectories in `INSTALL_DIR/groups/group-id/conf` that do not contain extracted federated entity stores. For example, if a `policy-archives` directory exists, remove it.

### FIPS mode only

If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Run `togglefips --disable` to turn FIPS mode off.
2. Start the Node Manager to move the JARs.
3. Stop the Node Manager.
4. Install the API Gateway update as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
5. Start the Node Manager.

In Policy Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Policy Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Policy Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Policy Studio using the `policystudio -clean` command.

In Configuration Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Configuration Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Configuration Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Configuration Studio using the `configurationstudio -clean` command.

### Installation

This section describes how to install the update on existing 7.7 installations of API Gateway or API Manager.

* If you have installed an existing version of API Manager, installing the API Gateway server update automatically also installs the updates and fixes for API Manager.
* If you have installed a licensed version of API Gateway or API Manager 7.7, you do not require a new license to install updates.

#### Install the API Gateway server update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway 7.7 server installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove any previous patches from your `INSTALL_DIR/ext/lib` and `INSTALL_DIR/META-INF` directories (or the `ext/lib` directory in an API Gateway instance). These patches have already been included in this update. You do not need to copy patches from a previous version.
3. Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 server Update file into a new directory. For example:

   ```
   mkdir 77update
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Core_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
   ```

    {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.{{< /alert >}}
4. Run the [`update_apigw.sh` script](#update-apigw-sh-script) from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify  your API Gateway installation directory using the `--install_dir` option. For example:

   ```
   ./update_apigw.sh --install_dir /opt/Axway-7.7/
   ```
5. Restart your Node Manager and API Gateway instances on the local machine.

##### `update_apigw.sh` script

Run the `update_apigw.sh` script with the `--help` option to see the available options:

```
./update_apigw.sh --help
```

The script generates a trace file in the `update-output/trace` directory. Use the `--tracelevel` option to change the level of tracing.

The script takes a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory and places it in a `tar` file in the `update-output/backups` directory. Specify a different directory using the `--backup_dir` option. To manage your own backups, use the `--no_backup` option.

To run the script without user interaction, specify `--mode unattended` option.

Running the `update_apigw.sh` script performs the following steps:

1. Check that the installation directory is valid.
2. Check that the user who owns the API Gateway binaries is the same user running the `update_apigw.sh` script.
3. Check that the Node Manager and API Gateway instances that run on the local machine are not running.
4. Take a backup unless `--no_backup` has been specified.
5. Install the update content into the API Gateway installation directory.
6. Perform all of the steps that were performed by a post installation script in earlier updates. This includes JRE cleanup, `system/lib/modules` cleanup, third-party and Axway JAR cleanup, apply `acl.json` fix, apply passphrase obfuscation fix, and apply modifications to Node Manager entity store configuration. Fixes are only applied if they have not previously been applied.

#### Install the Policy Studio update

To install the update on your existing Policy Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio`. {{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_policy_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `policystudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `policystudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Policy Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_policy_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update over the `policystudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Policy Studio with `policystudio -clean`.

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/policystudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the Configuration Studio update

To install the update on your existing Configuration Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio`.{{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_configuration_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `configurationstudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `configurationstudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Configuration Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_configuration_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update over the `configurationstudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Configuration Studio with `configurationstudio -clean`

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/configurationstudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the API Gateway Analytics update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway Analytics 7.7 installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway Analytics instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove old third-party libraries by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/system/lib/modules
   ```
3. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/platform/jre
   ```
4. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/analytics/posix/bin
   ```
5. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway Analytics binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Analytics Update over the `analytics` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory. For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Analytics_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/analytics/
   ```
6. Change to the `analytics` directory in your installation:

   ```
   cd INSTALL_DIR/analytics
   ```
7. Run the post-install script for API Gateway Analytics.

   ```
   apigw_analytics_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

You must also install an update for your existing API Gateway 7.7 server.

### After installation

The following steps apply after installing the update.

#### API Gateway

To allow an unprivileged user to run the API Gateway on a Linux system, perform the following steps:

1. Add the following line to the `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file:

   ```
   <VMArg name="-Djava.library.path=$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64/server:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib/engines:$VDISTDIR/ext/$DISTRIBUTION/lib:$VDISTDIR/ext/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib:system/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib"/>
   ```
2. Run the command `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep cap_sys_rawio=+ep' INSTALL_DIR/platform/bin/vshell` to allow the API Gateway to listen on privileged ports.

#### API Manager

When API Manager is installed, you must run the `update-apimanager` script after the API Gateway post-install script to ensure that all paths are up-to-date. For details, see [Run update-apimanager](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/#run-update-apimanager).

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}} Before executing the `update-apimanager` script:

* Apply the update to all API Gateways.
* Ensure that all Node Managers and API Gateway instances are running.

{{< /alert >}}

## Update a container deployment

If a `fed` file is provided as part of building the API Manager container, you must follow these steps to update the `fed` with the configuration changes:

1. Install the update on a installation of the API Gateway.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   /opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --fed <path to old file>.fed --oa <path to update file>.fed
   ```

You do not need to run any API Manager instances.

The `fed` now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.
