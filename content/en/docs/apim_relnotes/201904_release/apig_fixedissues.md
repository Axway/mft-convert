| RDAPI-12306 | 00949535                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: API Gateway Manager UI was vulnerable to path traversal attack from unauthenticated users. **Resolution**: API Gateway Manager UI is no longer vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |   |
| RDAPI-13768 | 00969445                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: Cannot limit the number of simultaneous open WebSockets for a client IP address. **Resolution**: You can now configure the WebSocket listener with a policy to trigger when the connection is closed. You must configure a com.axway.websocket.policy.onclose Java global property in the jvm.xml file with the reference to the policy called.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |
| RDAPI-13877 | 00987148                     | CVE 2018-1199                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Issue**: API Gateway included Spring framework version 4.3.5.RELEASE, which has a number of vulnerabilities including CVE-2018-1199. **Resolution**: API Gateway includes Spring framework version 4.3.18.RELEASE, which addresses known vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   |
| RDAPI-13952 | 00976711                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: API Gateway does not fail the decryption of a PGP-encrypted signed message when the Verify option is selected in the filter. **Resolution**: The decryption fails in this case by default. The Decrypt with PGP filter now has a new option 'Fail decrypt if One Pass and not signed' to control this behavior. In earlier versions, the system property pgpFailDecryptNoSignature controlled this behavior. If the system property is set to false, you must deselect the new option 'Fail decrypt if One Pass and not signed' to have the same behavior. |   |
| RDAPI-13959 | 00998337                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: On receiving a message body containing the string <!DOCTYPE>, the Threatening Content filter only reported an error if that string was uppercase, which incorrectly allowed XXE strings through the filter to be processed by downstream filters and policies and possibly sent on to back-end systems. **Resolution**: The Threatening Content filter performs a case-insensitive match against the <!DOCTYPE> string and reports an error.                                                                                                               |   |
| RDAPI-14182 | 01004262                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: URL with a number of slashes causes crash in API Gateway. **Resolution**: API Gateway correctly handles long URLs in memory.  |   |
| RDAPI-14190 | 00976396, 00933466           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: Submitting a token request without specifying any scope would return all application scopes and scopes of APIs that are associated with the application. **Resolution**: You can now select an option in API Manager settings to apply application scope restrictions, or set the JVM property `<VMArg name="-Dcom.apimanager.application.oauth.restrictScopes=true"/>` to return only those scopes which have been added to the application as Application Level scopes and marked as default.                                                              |   |
| RDAPI-14458 | 00981694                     | CVE-2016-1000338, CVE-2016-1000339,CVE-2016-1000340, CVE-2016-1000341,CVE-2016-1000342, CVE-2016-1000343,CVE-2016-1000344, CVE-2016-1000345, CVE-2016-1000346, CVE-2016-1000352, CVE-2017-13098 | **Issue**: API Gateway included Bouncy Castle library version 1.55 which contained vulnerabilities. **Resolution**: API Gateway now includes Bouncy Castle library version 1.60 and is no longer vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   |
| RDAPI-14607 | 00989768, 00990108, 01014125 |                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Issue**: Location header in 303 See Other response displayed absolute URIs to host specified in Host header, which could be modified and cause a security issue. **Resolution**: Location header now contains a relative URI by default, according to RFC 7231. To display absolute URIs in the Location header,set the com.axway.response.redirect.location.relative Java system property to false in INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/system/conf/jvm.xml.                                                                                                                  |   |

| RDAPI-13374 | 00949984                               | **Issue**: API Gateway OAuth Authorization Code Flow filter had limited diagnostic output in traces for troubleshooting. **Resolution**: The Authorization Code Flow filter produces more detailed diagnostic output in traces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| RDAPI-13850 | 00974976, 00982285, 00975245, 00997479 | **Issue**: Trailing slashes not always processed correctly for inbound requests in SOAP and REST APIs. **Resolution**: You can set the new com.vordel.apimanager.uri.path.trailingSlash.preserve Java property to 'true' to allow inbound API requests with trailing slash to match API path with no trailing slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| RDAPI-13881 | 00968176                               | **Issue**: When using the implicit OAuth flow, the token response did not include scopes for the token in the location header of the response, even when the scopes were different to the request, as required by the specification. **Resolution**: The implicit OAuth token response always contains the scopes whether they are different from the requested scopes or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| RDAPI-13926 | 00996887                               | **Issue**: Traffic Monitoring UI fails to display non-HTTP transactions if the API Gateway instance did not have any HTTP traffic yet. **Resolution**: The absence of HTTP schema in OpsDB configuration is now correctly handled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| RDAPI-13932 | 00998723, 00997199                     | **Issue**: Cannot create OCSP Client, Security Token Service Client, or XACML PEP filters in Policy Studio because of a missing resource. **Resolution**: The filters can now be created successfully in Policy Studio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| RDAPI-13934 | 00983915                               | **Issue**: Visual Data Mapper fails to transform XML to JSON when XML reference types were used. **Resolution**: The error no longer occurs when transforming XML to JSON using XML reference types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| RDAPI-13946 |                                        | **Issue**: HTTP Status Codes are incorrect in API Manager specific fault response. 500 error is always returned. Also SOAP error response needs to respect HTTP error code. **Resolution**: API Manager specific fault response now sends the correct status code, and the SOAP fault code is returned respecting the HTTP error response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| RDAPI-13956 | 00970289                               | **Issue**: Inconsistent data in the audit log for API access and applications in API Manager. **Resolution**: Inconsistencies in audit log messages for API access and application CRUD operations have been removed. Now the **message** field contains human readable object names, and object UUIDs are written to the **metadata** field. Inconsistencies in audit log messages for organizations and permissions have also been consolidated.                                                                                                                                                              |
| RDAPI-13973 | 00956029                               | **Issue**: When the Metrics database was changed for API Manager in Policy Studio, the change was not saved and no data was displayed in the UI anymore. **Resolution**: When the Metrics database is changed, the user is prompted to save the change before continuing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| RDAPI-14004 | 00979243                               | **Issue**: Incoming requests for URLs containing encoded extended ASCII characters could result in error when writing Traffic Monitoring records and cause memory leak. **Resolution**: The extended ASCII characters are no longer treated as a malformed UTF-8 string, and thememory leak no longer happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| RDAPI-14008 | 00966062                               | **Issue**: When using the "Connect To URL" filter to connect to a remote host in an External Identity Provider circuit, the connections would never be released back to the connection pool once the processing was completed. **Resolution**: The remote host connections are released at the end of processing requests to an External Identity Provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RDAPI-14015 | 00999506                               | **Issue**: API Gateway returns 404 error for REST API methods designed to consume content types. **Resolution**: API Gateway REST API method content types check works as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| RDAPI-14017 | 00993963                               | **Issue**: managedomain displayed an invalid group passphrase error when Submit externally signed certificate was used. **Resolution**: Using Submit externally signed certificate option does not result in error anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RDAPI-14022 | 00992660                               | **Issue**: Using the Find Certificate filter causes memory leak. **Resolution**: Native components are now correctly freed when an error is raised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| RDAPI-14067 | 00986597                               | **Issue**: You cannot create API Manager users with commas in their name. The validation failure was not being written to the trace log. **Resolution**: Commas are permitted in the names of API Manager users, and validation errors for new users are logged correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| RDAPI-14089 | 00983879                               | **Issue**: Cannot environmentalize open traffic event log settings in Policy Studio. **Resolution**: Open traffic event log settings can be environmentalized in Policy Studio directly under Server Settings > Logging > Open Traffic Event Log or by navigating to the configuration from Environment Configuration > Environment Settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| RDAPI-14122 | 00978019                               | **Issue**: Duplicate claim error when adding a "sub" claim as an additional JWT claim in the OAuth client (External Connections > Client Credentials > OAuth2). Adding a "kid" claim to be included in the JWT header was not supported. **Resolution**: Additional JWT claims for "sub" and "kid" are fully supported and work as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| RDAPI-14333 |                                        | **Issue**: Key Property Store (KPS) does not cache the identifier of a record that does not exist. This results in unnecessary database requests and poor performance. **Resolution**: API Gateway now caches the request to a record that does not exist, which reduces database hits and improves performance.Note: Do not enable KPS caching for internal tables. These are API Portal, API Server, or OAUTH collections.                                                                                                                                                                                |

| RDAPI-15319 | 01022535                               | **Issue**: Policies misplaced on Policy Studio Policies tree when a project dependency is added with the same name as a container in the parent project. **Resolution**: Policies show correctly in the Policies tree now even when a project dependency has the same name as a container in the parent project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RDAPI-15349 | 01007579                               | **Issue**: kpsadmin commands could sometimes reach the standard transaction timeout before completion. **Resolution**: kpsadmin commands now run until completion. The kpsadmin command result report now also shows the duration length (in seconds) and the final HTTP response status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| RDAPI-15378 | 01023734                               | **Issue**: API Gateway XSLT Transformation filter incorrectly alters some UTF-8 characters. **Resolution**: API Gateway XML parser has been fixed. However, the Apache Xalan transformer may still cause invalid output. You can solve this issue by configuring XML output or changing the provider (for example, to net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl) in the filter's Advanced settings. Note: Your system must now also be configured for UTF-8. You can do this by defining a system locale supporting UTF-8 (for example, "en_US.UTF-8"), or adding the -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 JVM startup parameter. |
