## Summary

API Portal provides an API consumer-facing interface that you can customize to match your corporate brand. API Portal is a layered product linked to API Manager, and requires both API Manager and API Gateway. For more information, see the API Gateway and API Manager documentation.

## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in a Docker container. For more information, see the following options:

* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/).
* You can use the [cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script) to upgrade directly from earlier versions (for example, 7.5.5, 7.6.2) to API Portal July 20, then apply this package to update your API Portal to the September 20 release.
* See [API Portal single version upgrade](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-from-api-portal-7-6-2) to upgrade versions incrementally.

API Portal in Docker containers is available for production environment from [API Portal 7.7 November 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/) update.

*This section was updated to amend the information about API Portal in Docker containers.*

## New features and enhancements

### Multiple organizations membership

Building on the support now added in API Manager for a user being a member of multiple organizations, the user profile in API Portal will reflect all of their organization memberships, and the user will be able to see all APIs and all applications from all organizations that they are a member of. For more information, see [Users membership to multiple organizations](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/).

### GDPR compliance

Users can request a copy of their API Portal and Joomla! data to be sent to a nominated email address. They can also request that their data is deleted from API Portal and Joomla!, including data recorded in audit logs. For more information, see [Manage privacy and personal data](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/manage_privacy_personal_data/).

### Security

Users can enable [two-factor authentication](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/secure_harden_portal/#enable-two-factor-authentication) (2FA) for both API Portal website and Joomla! Administrator Interface.

### UI/UX improvements

User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) improvements in this release:

* You can search APIs by **custom properties** in the API catalog.​
* Date and time are displayed in the users time zone.

## Limitations of this update

This update has the following limitations:

* API Portal 7.7.20200930 is compatible with API Gateway and API Manager 7.7.20200930 only.
* Upgrade directly to API Portal 7.7.20200930 is supported from [API Portal 7.7](/docs/apim_relnotes/201904_release/apip_relnotes/) only.
* This update is not available as a virtual appliance or as a managed service on Axway Cloud.

*This section was updated to remove the information about API Portal in Docker containers.*

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

### API version update

To support [User membership in multiple organizations](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/#user-membership-in-multiple-organizations) (multi-orgs), a new version of the API v1.4 was introduced. The multi-orgs feature is available with the 1.4 version of the API only, meaning that any third-party portals or integrations (for example, SSO) must be updated to use version 1.4. The API Manager UI uses the API 1.4 by default.

This feature is forward compatible, the API 1.4 will work with single-org users, but not backward compatible, you cannot configure multi-orgs in the API 1.4, then revert it to the API 1.3.

The new **API Manager 7.7 API 1.4** is available in OAS3 format on the [Axway Documentation portal](https://docs.axway.com/category/api).

| IAP-3388    | 1173080 | **Issue**: Control buttons for removing array items in Swagger UI were appearing on a new line. **Resolution**: The controls now appear next to the array item.                                                                            |
| IAP-3517    | 1188465 | **Issue**: In API Portal all header names sent along with Try-It requests are Pascal-Case, but when there is no dash, like in KeyId, the transformation results to Keyid. **Resolution**: Headers are Pascal-Case only if there is a dash. |
| IAP-3518    |         | **Issue**: Manual password is not set when org admins create users because of invalid password argument passed. **Resolution**: Correct password argument is passed.                                                                       |

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working in releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
