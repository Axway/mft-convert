}

API Manager can generate alerts when specific events occur. For example, it can generate an alert when an organization is created or deleted, or when access is granted to an API. When an alert is generated by API Manager you can execute a custom policy to handle the alert. Sample policies are provided as a starting point for custom development.  

You can enable or disable alerts in the API Manager web interface. You can change the policy that is executed when an alert is generated in Policy Studio.  

You can use alerts for many different use cases. For example, to send an e-mail to an interested party, or to forward the alert to an external notification system. The following video shows how you can integrate with JIRA, for example, to generate issues there. You can then set up the necessary workflows in JIRA for your use case.

## Alert descriptions

Alerts are categorized according to the type of event that generates the alert, for example, organization events are in a different category to application events. The following sections list the alerts in each category, and detail the event that triggers the alert, and the type of the alert (governance or runtime). Events initiated by a person (for example, an administrator approves an API consumer registration) are governance alerts. Events that occur during normal operation of the system are runtime alerts.

## Application alerts and events

API Manager generates application alerts for events relating to managing applications.

## Application credential alerts and events

You can use application credential alerts when you want to trigger alerts for any change to the credentials (API keys, OAuth credentials, or external credentials) associated with an application. Application credential alerts are fully configurable:

* Policy developers can write policies that will be invoked when application credentials are created, updated, deleted, enabled, or disabled. For more information, see [Change the alert policy to execute](#change-the-alert-policy-to-execute). For more information on the message attributes available to application credential alert policies, see [Alert message attributes](#application-credential-alert-properties).
* API administrators can enable or disable alerts for application credentials so that the configured policies get executed when the specified events are triggered. For more information, see [Enable or disable alerts](#enable-or-disable-alerts).

API Manager generates application credential alerts for events relating to application credentials.

| Alert Name                     | Alert Type | Trigger Event                               |
|--------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Create Application Credential  | Governance | When an application credential is created.  |
| Delete Application Credential  | Governance | When an application credential is deleted.  |
| Enable Application Credential  | Governance | When an application credential is enabled.  |
| Disable Application Credential | Governance | When an application credential is disabled. |
| Update Application Credential  | Governance | When an application credential is updated.  |

When an application credential alert is triggered, the following users are notified:

* The application developer that created the application associated with the credential being created, modified, or deleted.
* Any application developer that has manage permissions for the application associated with the credential being created, modified, or deleted.

## Enable or disable alerts

You can enable or disable alerts in the API Manager web interface. Click the **Settings** > **Alerts**
view in API Manager. Alerts are disabled by default.

The following figure shows the view of API management alerts in API Manager.

![Web-based API management alerts](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_alerts.png)

To enable or disable an alert, click the **On/Off**
button next to the alert. Changes are saved automatically.

## Change the alert policy to execute

When an enabled alert is generated, the policy associated with that alert is executed. The alert context provides the policy with a number of message attributes. These are specific to the alert being generated (for example, `alert.application`, `alert.appdev`, `alert.organization`). By default, each alert is configured to execute a sample policy, and the sample policy demonstrates the attributes from the respective alert context. You can change what happens when an alert is generated, either by modifying the sample policy associated with the alert, or by creating a custom policy and associating that policy with the alert.

You can change the policy that is executed when an alert is generated in Policy Studio. To view the API management alerts and the associated policies, click the **Server Settings**
node in the Policy Studio tree view. On the **Server Settings**
tab, expand the **API Manager**
tree node and click **Alerts**.

The following figure shows the view of API management alerts in Policy Studio.

![Policy-based API management alerts](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_alerts_ps.png)

To modify the sample policy associated with an alert, click the sample policy link next to the alert.

To associate a different policy with an alert, click the row containing the alert, and click the **Edit**
button. In the dialog, click the browse button to select a new **Alert Policy**
and then click **OK**. To save any changes, click the **Save**
button.

## Alert message attributes

This topic describes the message attributes that are available to the configured alert policies.

The following tables outline the message properties that are generated for each alert. All message property values are in string format. Message properties are only available if a value exists for the entity field in question.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}To discover available properties, you can include a [Trace filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/utility_common/#trace-filter) in the triggered alert policy. This gives you a list of all attributes and their values.{{< /alert >}}
