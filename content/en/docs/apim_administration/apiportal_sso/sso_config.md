description: Configure single sign-on (SSO) and enable it for your API Portal users.
---

## Prerequisites

* You must have a third-party IdP installed and running.
* The IdP posts SAML assertions to API Portal. When configuring the IDP for a new API Portal client, you must set the post back addresses to API Portal.
* You must always use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for the host name. Avoid using IP addresses or `localhost` in the configuration.

The following prerequisites apply to organizations in API Manager:

* Before a user can authenticate successfully using SSO, the API Portal organization associated with the SSO user must exist.
* An API Manager administrator user can add the organizations in advance.
* When configuring the file `service-provider-apiportal.xml`, ensure that the SSO user only ever belongs to one organization.

## Configuration files

To configure API Portal SSO, create the following files in your API Gateway instance folder. For example:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf
```

* `service-provider-apiportal.xml`: This file defines how API Portal interacts in the SSO, the Service Provider (SP), the SAML Identity Provider (IdP), and the mappings that can be made by the SAML IdP. In this case the SP is API Manager. For more information, see [Create a service-provider-apiportal.xml file](#create-a-service-provider-apiportal-xml-file).
* A keystore (for example, `sso.jks`): This is the truststore generated by an administrator and referenced in `service-provider-apiportal.xml`. It contains the key that the SSO agent uses to sign requests. The exported public key must be stored by the IdP. For more information, see [Manage IdP certificates](#manage-idp-certificates).
* `idp.xml` (optional): This file is required if you are specifying the IdP by file. For more information, see [Specify the IdP by file](#specify-the-idp-by-file).
* `jvm.xml`: This file is located at `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf`, and can be used to configure the SSO cookie domain name. It is only required when using a load balancer. See [Configure the SSO cookie domain name](#configure-the-sso-cookie-domain-name).

Your API Gateway installation includes sample files that may help you configure API Portal SSO. These are located in the following folder:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso`
```

For more details, see [API Manager configuration files](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/#configuration-files).

## Set up a keystore

Set up a keystore containing a key pair to your API Gateway instance. For more details, see [Configure the IdP](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/#step-1-configure-the-idp).

## Create a service-provider-apiportal.xml file

To create a `service-provider-apiportal.xml` file to your API Gateway instance, use the following sample file included in the API Gateway installation:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso/keycloak/service-provider-apiportal.xml
```

The sample file contains useful information about what sections you must change to match your environment.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
Do not change any settings with paths containing `/sso`, unless otherwise instructed.
{{< /alert >}}

1. To enable reverse proxying, check the following:

   * `excludeHostInEndpointURICheck` is set to `true`.
   * `relaxedEndpointURICheckHostDetails` is not present, or if present, is set to your API Portal host (`https://<FQDN>:<port>`).
2. In the `ServiceProvider` section, update the `keystore`, `keystorePassphrase`, and `keyAlias` fields with the correct values for your keystore.

   For example, if you generated a keystore called `sso.jks` with a passphrase `abc123` and an alias called `ssokey`, the settings are as follows:

   ```
   <ServiceProvider
       ...
       keystore="conf/sso.jks"
       keystorePassphrase="abc123"
       keyAlias="ssokey"
       ...
   </ServiceProvider>
   ```
3. In the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, update the `Mappings` section with the mapping of IdP attributes to API Manager attributes. For more information on the mapping syntax, see [Mapping syntax](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_sso/sso_mapping/).
4. In the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, change references to `keycloak.int.acme.com:8443` to the FQDN and port of your IdP.
5. In the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, set the `metadataUrl` field as detailed in [Specify the IdP by file](#specify-the-idp-by-file) or [Specify the IdP by URL](#specify-the-idp-by-url), and save the configuration file.

For more information on the elements in the `service-provider-apiportal.xml` configuration file, see [configuration file reference](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_sso/sso_mapping/#service-provider-apiportal-xml-configuration-file-reference).

### Specify the IdP by file

When the IdP is specified by file, the `idp.xml` file must exist in your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`). In this case, `service-provider-apiportal.xml` refers to this file on disk.

To specify the IdP by file in `service-provider-apiportal.xml`, follow these steps:

1. In the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, set the `metadataUrl` field to the value `./idp.xml`.

   The following example shows a sample extract from the `service-provider-apiportal.xml` file for Keycloak. The `metadataUrl` refers to the file `idp.xml`:

   ```
   <SamlIdentityProvider
         entityId="https://keycloak.int.acme.com:8443/auth/realms/Axway"
         metadataUrl="./idp.xml"
         ...
   </SamlIdentityProvider>
   ```
2. Create an `idp.xml` file to your API Gateway instance folder using the following templates:

   * For Shibbloteh, use the template provided in `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso/ShibbolethIDP/idp.xml`.
   * For Keycloak, enter the URL of the Keycloak realm you are configuring (for example,`https://<Keycloak FQDN>:<port>/auth/realms/<realm>`) to your browser, and use the shown content as the template for the `idp.xml`. You can also use a utility such as Wget to save the content as a file.

   Replace the placeholders in the file with the details of your IdP.

### Specify the IdP by URL

When the IdP is specified by URL, the IdP file is not stored locally. Instead, `service-provider-apiportal.xml` references it using a URL.

To specify the IdP by URL in `service-provider-apiportal.xml`, in the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, set the `metadataURL` field to the metadata URL of the IdP.

The following example shows an extract from a `service-provider-apiportal.xml` file for a Keycloak IdP. The `metadataUrl` refers to a URL.

```
<SamlIdentityProvider
        entityId="https://keycloak.int.acme.com:8443/auth/realms/Axway"
        metadataUrl="https://keycloak.int.acme.com:8443/auth/realms/Axway/protocol/saml/descriptor"
        ...
</SamlIdentityProvider>
```

A sample of a `service-provider-apiportal.xml` file that uses an IdP specified by URL is included in the `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso/keycloak` folder.

When specifying an IdP by URL, you might need to set up a truststore JKS file:

* `sso.jks` – Contains the key used by the SSO agent to sign requests. This key needs to go to the IdP.
* `truststore.jks` – This is a separate truststore that is used for HTTPS communication between the SSO agent and the IdP while retrieving metadata online.

You can use the same keystore for all of the operations.

## Configure SSO in Policy Studio

After configuring and saving `service-provider-apiportal.xml`, you must configure the SSO connection between your API Gateway and API Portal. This configuration is the same as when configuring API Manager SSO. For more details, see [Configure SSO in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/#step-3-configure-sso-in-policy-studio).

## Configure SAML endpoint URLs

After configuring the SSO, you must define the SAML endpoint of API Portal in the IdP. This endpoint is the URL that receives SAML assertions from the IdP.

In the following example, the IdP is Keycloak. Depending on your IdP, the UI might be different, but you must define the endpoint URLs regardless of which IdP you use. For more details, see the documentation of your IdP.

Open your IdP client, locate and set the following:

**Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL**:

* For versions earlier than API Portal 7.7 September: `https://<API Portalhost FQDN>/api/portal/v1.3/sso/externallogin/post`
* For API Portal 7.7 September and later: `https://<API Portalhost FQDN>/api/portal/v1.4/sso/externallogin/post`

**logout-service-post-binding-url**:

* For versions earlier than API Portal 7.7 September: `https://<API Portal host FQDN>/api/portal/v1.3/sso/externallogout/post`
* For API Portal 7.7 September and later: `https://<API Portal host FQDN>/api/portal/v1.4/sso/externallogout/post`

**Logout Service Redirect Binding URL**:

* For versions earlier than API Portal 7.7 September: `https://<API Portal host FQDN>/api/portal/v1.3/sso/externallogout/post`
* For API Portal 7.7 September and later: `https://<API Portal host FQDN>/api/portal/v1.4/sso/externallogout/post`

![An example on configuring the endpoints](/Images/APIPortal/FineGrainSAMLEndPointsAPIPortal.png)

You must configure the endpoint URLs separately for both API Manager and API Portal. For more details, see [Configure API Manager SSO](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/).

## Additional configuration in API Manager and API Gateway

Because API Portal is dependent of API Manager and API Gateway, you must configure some things outside API Portal. These configurations are the same when configuring API Manager SSO, so if you have already configured API Manager SSO, or are planning to do so, you do not have to repeat them separately for API Portal.

### Manage IdP certificates

API Portal relies on API Manager to process the SAML assertions in the requests. API Manager uses a certificate to sign SAML requests. The IdP requires the public key to verify the validity and provenance of the SAML requests from API Manager, so you must import the public key to the IdP. For more details, see [Configure the IdP](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/#step-1-configure-the-idp).

### Configure the SSO cookie domain name

This implementation of SSO uses a cookie, which is created on the API Gateway server and sent to the client's browser. One property of this cookie is the domain name. The default domain name is the API Gateway host name.

If the API Gateway is hidden behind a load balancer, you might need to change the cookie domain name because the client's browser is not aware of the internal API Gateway host name and therefore might not accept the cookie. For more details, see [Configure the SSO cookie domain name](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/#step-5-configure-the-sso-cookie-domain-name-optional).

## Enable SSO in API Portal

After configuring `service-provider-apiportal.xml` and the single sign-on (SSO) connection in Policy Studio, enable SSO in API Portal.

1. In the Joomla! Administrator Interface (JAI), click **Components > API Portal > Single-Sign-On**.
2. Click **Yes** to enable SSO login.
3. In **SSO Client Entity ID**, enter the `entityId` you defined for API Portal in `service-provider-apiportal.xml`.
4. In **SSO Whitelist**, enter the host name or IP address of your IdP to allow requests to the IdP (for example, `keycloak.lab.dubl.axway.int`). If you do not add your IdP to this field, all requests to your IdP will be rejected by API Portal.
5. Click **Save**.

## Change API Portal SSO login path

The default SSO login URL is `https://<FQDN>:<port>/sso`, where `<FQDN>` is the fully qualified domain name of the machine running API Portal, and `<port>` is the API Portal listening port. To modify the SSO login URL:

1. In JAI, click **Components > API Portal > Single-Sign-On**.
2. In **SSO Path**, replace the default value `/sso` with the new path (for example, `/newpath`results in a new SSO login URL of `https://<FQDN>:<port>/newpath`.
3. Click **Save**.
