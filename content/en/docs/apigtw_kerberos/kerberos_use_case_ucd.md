"description": "A client application can authenticate to API Gateway using Kerberos by way of delegating its Kerberos credentials to API Gateway, which acts as an intermediary between a Kerberos client and Kerberos back-end services"
}

When authenticating to API Gateway using Kerberos, a client application can delegate its Kerberos credentials to API Gateway. API Gateway acts as an intermediary between a Kerberos client and Kerberos back-end services, and requests service tickets to any other Kerberos service in the same Kerberos realm on behalf of the client. These service tickets can then be used to authenticate the original end user to the other Kerberos services. This type of Kerberos delegation is often called *unconstrained* or *open*.

In this scenario:

* **Client application**: Supports Kerberos authentication.
* **Back-end service**: Requires Kerberos authentication with the end user's credentials. Multiple back-end services may exist.
* **API Gateway**: Acts as both a Kerberos service and client, and authenticates to different back-end services as the end user.

API Gateway receives a request from the Kerberos client containing a SPNEGO token with the credentials to be delegated (the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)). The token also contains a service ticket that allows the Kerberos client to authenticate to API Gateway that is itself acting as a Kerberos service.

Using Kerberos authentication, API Gateway authenticates the Kerberos client. API Gateway then requests a service ticket to the back-end Kerberos service on behalf of the client, and authenticates to the back-end service as the original end user. The client application itself does not need to have any knowledge of any of the back-end services that API Gateway might invoke on its behalf.

A safer method for credentials delegation in Kerberos authentication is *constrained* delegation. In constrained delegation with protocol transition, the Kerberos service can obtain a Kerberos service ticket to itself on behalf of a Kerberos principal (end user) without requiring the principal to initially authenticate using Kerberos. Constrained delegation also restricts which back-end services the Kerberos service can request Kerberos service tickets on behalf of the client. The credential delegation is only allowed to a constrained set of Kerberos services that are configured in the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). For more details, see [API Gateway in Kerberos constrained delegation](/docs/apigtw_kerberos/kerberos_use_case_kcd/).

## Prerequisites

Before you start configuration, you must have API Gateway installed on any machine with access to the Windows Domain Controller. The machine does *not* have to be a Windows machine that is part of the Windows Domain.

## Example names

The example name for the intermediary Kerberos service used in this guide is `IntermediaryGateway`.

The example Kerberos realm name `AXWAY.COM` is specific to the examples in this guide. Replace the example realm name with your own realm name.

The next sections describe the steps to configure the gateway in unconstrained credentials delegation.

## Configure Active Directory

This section describes how to configure a Kerberos service principal for API Gateway in Active Directory acting as the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

1. On the Windows Domain Controller, click **Control panel > Administrative Tools > Active Directory User and Computers**.
2. Right-click **Users**, and select **New > User**.
3. Enter a name for the Kerberos principal (such as `IntermediaryGateway`) in the **First Name** and **User Logon Name** fields, select your Active Directory domain from the drop-down menu (`@axway.com`), and click **Next**.
4. Enter the password, and do the following:
    * **User must change password at next logon**: Deselect this.
    * **User cannot change password**: Select this.
    * **Password never expires**: Select this.

    This ensures that a working API Gateway configuration does not stop working when a user chooses, or is prompted to change their password. API Gateway does not track these actions.

    If these options are not suitable in your implementation and a user password changes in Active Directory, you must then update the password or keytab of the Kerberos client or service related to the user in Policy Studio, and redeploy the configuration to API Gateway.
    If you cannot deselect **User must change password at next logon**, ensure the user changes the password and that the new password or keytab is deployed to API Gateway before API Gateway attempts to connect as this user.

    You can store Kerberos passwords in a KPS table to update a changed password in runtime. For more details, see [Use KPS to store passwords for Kerberos authentication](/docs/apigtw_kerberos/kerberos_kps).

5. Click **Next > Finish**.
6. Map a Service Principal Name (SPN) to the user account. The Kerberos client uses the SPN to uniquely identify a service. To map the SPN, open a command prompt on the Windows Domain Controller, and enter the following command:

    ```
    ktpass -princ HTTP/<host>@<Kerberos realm> -mapuser <user> -pass password -out <user>.keytab -crypto rc4-hmac-nt -kvno 0
    ```

    The SPN is of the format `HTTP/<host>@<Kerberos realm>`, where `<host>` is the name of the host running the Kerberos service, `IntermediaryGateway` in this case:

    ```
    ktpass -princ HTTP/IntermediaryGateway.axway.com@AXWAY.COM -mapuser IntermediaryGateway -pass Axway123 -out IntermediaryGateway.keytab -crypto rc4-hmac-nt -kvno 0
    ```

    Replace the example Kerberos realm name with your own realm name. Note that the realm name is uppercase.

    The command creates an SPN `HTTP/IntermediaryGateway.axway.com@AXWAY.COM`, which is mapped to the `IntermediaryGateway` user account. The command also creates a keytab file for the account that you can use later when configuring a Kerberos service for API Gateway in Policy Studio. See [Configure API Gateway policy](/docs/apigtw_kerberos/kerberos_use_case_ucd#configure-api-gateway-policy).

    If you do not want to create a keytab file, you can use the following command:

    ```
    setspn -A HTTP/<host> <user>
    ```

    As a Kerberos service, API Gateway authenticates the client application using Kerberos authentication. For the authentication to succeed, the client application or end user    must also have an account configured in your Active Directory. For an example configuration for the client account, see [Configure a user account in Active Directory](/docs/apigtw_kerberos/kerberos_use_case_client#configure-a-user-account-in-active-directory). You must also configure user accounts and Service Principal Names (SPN) for the back-end services you want API   Gateway to request service tickets for.

7. Right-click on the new user, and select **Properties > Delegation**. Then, select the **Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)** option.

This is required for the API Gateway to extract delegated credentials when using unconstrained delegation where the client is the browser.

## Configure Kerberos principals

This section describes how to add Kerberos principals for the intermediary Kerberos service, and back-end Kerberos service for unconstrained credentials delegation using Policy Studio.

1. In the node tree, click **Environment Configuration > External Connections > Kerberos Principals**.
2. Add a new Kerberos principal for the intermediary Kerberos service account as follows:
    * **Name**: `IntermediaryGateway`
    * **Principal Name**: `IntermediaryGateway@AXWAY.COM`
    * **Principal Type**: `NT_USER_NAME`
3. Add a new Kerberos principal for the back-end Kerberos service account as follows:
    * **Name**: `<Back-end service name>` (for example, `Back-end Kerberos Service`)
    * **Principal Name**: `<Service Principal Name for the back-end service>` (for example, `HOST/BackEndService.axway.com@AXWAY.COM`)
    * **Principal Type**: `NT_USER_NAME`

For more details on the fields and options in this configuration window, see [Configure Kerberos principals](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_external_connections/common_client_credentials/#configure-kerberos-principals).

## Configure API Gateway policy

This section describes for unconstrained credential delegation using Policy Studio.

### Configure an intermediary Kerberos service

1. In the node tree, click **Environment Configuration > External Connections > Kerberos Services**.
2. Click **Add a Kerberos Service**, and enter a name for your Kerberos service (`IntermediaryGateway Kerberos Service for Unconstrained Delegation`).
3. On the **Kerberos Endpoint** tab, set the following:
    * **Kerberos Principal**: `IntermediaryGateway`.
    * **Enter Password**: Enter the password for `IntermediaryGateway@AXWAY.COM`.
    * **Enabled**: Select this option.
4. On the **Advanced** tab, set the following:
    **Mechanism**: `SPNEGO_MECHANISM`.
    **Extract delegated credentials**: Select this option.

Selecting **Extract delegated credentials** means that API Gateway extracts the Kerberos clientâ€™s TGT from the SPNEGO token after the client has been authenticated. API Gateway can then use the TGT to request service tickets to other Kerberos services on behalf of the Kerberos client. For more details on the fields and options in this configuration window, see [Configure Kerberos services](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_external_connections/kerberos_service/).

### Configure a Kerberos client for the delegated credentials

1. In the node tree, click **Environment Configuration > External Connections > Kerberos Clients**.
2. Click **Add a Kerberos Client**, and enter a name for your client (`Kerberos Client for Unconstrained Delegation`).
3. On the **Kerberos Endpoint** tab, set the following:
    * **Load from delegated credentials**: Select this option.
    * **Enabled**: Make sure this option is selected.
4. On the **Advanced** tab, set the following:
    * **Mechanism**: `SPNEGO_MECHANISM`.
    * **Context Settings**: Select the following options:
        * **Mutual authentication**
        * **Integrity**
        * **Confidentiality**
        * **Anonymity**
        * **Replay Detection**
        * **Sequence Checking**
    * **Synchronize to Avoid Replay Errors at Service**: Deselect this option to improve performance.
    * **Refresh when remaining validity is `<value>` seconds**: Set to `300`.

For more details on the fields and options in this configuration window, see [Configure Kerberos clients](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_external_connections/common_client_credentials/#configure-kerberos-clients).

### Configure a Kerberos profile for the intermediary Kerberos service

1. In the node tree, click **Environment Configuration > External Connections > Client Credentials > Kerberos**.
2. Add a Kerberos profile as follows:
    * **Profile Name**: `Authenticate to Back-End Service using Delegated Credentials`.
    * **Kerberos Client**: `Kerberos Client for Unconstrained Delegation`.
    * **Kerberos Service Principal**: `<Back-end Kerberos Service>`.
    * **Send token with first request**: Select this option.

### Configure an intermediary policy

The following section describes how to configure the policy for API Gateway delegating the credentials.

To start, add a new policy named, for example, `Kerberos Intermediary for Unconstrained Credentials Delegation`.

#### Configure a Kerberos service filter

1. Open the **Authentication** category in the filter palette, and drag a **Kerberos Service** filter onto the policy canvas.
2. Set **Kerberos Service** to the intermediary Kerberos service you created (`IntermediaryGateway Kerberos Service for Unconstrained Delegation`).
3. Change **Kerberos Standard** to **SPNEGO Over HTTP**, and click **Finish**.
4. Right-click the **Kerberos Service** filter, and select **Set as Start**.

#### Configure retrieving the end user credentials

1. Open the **Attributes** category in the palette, and drag a **Retrieve from HTTP Header** filter onto the policy canvas.
2. Set the **HTTP Header name** to `WWW-Authenticate` and **Attribute ID** to `outer.www.authenticate`, and click **Finish**.
3. Open the **Conversion** category in the palette, drag a **Remove HTTP Header** filter onto the policy canvas.
4. Set **HTTP Header Name** to `WWW-Authenticate`.

#### Configure authentication to the back-end service

1. Open the **Routing** category in the palette, and drag a **Connect to URL** filter onto the canvas.
2. Enter the **URL** used to invoke the back-end Kerberos service.
3. On the **Authentication** tab, select the Kerberos profile you configured (`Authenticate to Back-End Service using Delegated Credentials`), and click **Finish**.\
4. Open the **Conversion** category in the palette, and drag an **Add HTTP Header** filter onto the policy canvas.
5. Set the following, and click **Finish**:
    **HTTP Header Name**: `WWW-Authenticate`.
    **HTTP Header Value**: `${outer.www.authenticate}`.
    **Override existing header**: Select this option.
    **Add header to HTTP headers attribute**: Select this option.
6. Open the **Utility** category in the palette, and drag a **Reflect Message** filter onto the canvas.

### Build the policy

1. Click on the **Add Relative Path** icon to create a new relative path `/intermediary` that links to this policy.
2. Connect the filters with success paths.

    ![Intermediary policy filters](/Images/IntegrationGuides/KerberosIntegration/cred_deleg_spnego/imagePasted25.png)

The policy has the following flow:

* API Gateway receives a request from the end user, and uses the Kerberos token in the `Authorization` HTTP header to authenticate the end user.
* API Gateway extracts the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header and saves the value to a message attribute, so it can be reinstated later. This token is the response to the original token the end user sent.
* API Gateway retrieves a service ticket for the end user to access the back-end Kerberos service, connects to the back-end Kerberos service, and authenticates using the Kerberos credentials relating to the original end user.
* API Gateway reinstates the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP Header, overriding the value the back-end Kerberos service set.
* API Gateway sends the response to the Kerberos client.

### Configure Kerberos system settings

1. In the node tree, click **Environment Configuration > Server Settings > Security > Kerberos**, and click **Add Kerberos Configuration**.
2. On the **krb5.conf** tab, add the Kerberos settings as follows:
  
    ```
    [libdefaults]
    default_realm = AXWAY.COM

    [realms]
    AXWAY.COM = {
    kdc = dc.axway.com
    }
    ```

    Replace the realm settings in the example code with your Kerberos realm, and set the `kdc` setting to the host name of your Windows Domain Controller.

### Deploy the configuration

To deploy the configuration to API Gateway, click the **Deploy** icon.

You have now configured and deployed a policy for the authenticating Kerberos service on API Gateway that delegates the SPNEGO credentials to the back-end Kerberos service. The client application calls the policy on relative path `/intermediary`.

For demonstration purposes, you may want to add API Gateway as the client application and the back-end service. For example configurations, see [Demo setup: API Gateway as both Kerberos client and service](/docs/apigtw_kerberos/kerberos_use_case_demo). When configuring API Gateway as the client application for credentials delegation, the setting `forwardable` on the `krb5.conf` tab in the Kerberos system settings must be `true`:

```
[libdefaults]
default_realm = AXWAY.COM
forwardable=true

[realms]
AXWAY.COM = {
kdc = dc.axway.com
}
```

### Test the configuration

Use a client application to call the policy in API Gateway.

The back-end Kerberos service should send a confirmation on a successful authentication.

The **Traffic Monitor** tab on the API Gateway Manager (`https://localhost:8090`) is an excellent place to view and troubleshoot the message flows. For more details, see [Monitor services in API Gateway Manager](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/monitor_service/#monitor-services-in-api-gateway-manager).
