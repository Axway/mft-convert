Promotion and deployment involves moving API Gateway configuration from one environment to another (for example, from development to testing to production), and configuring environment-specific values so that the configuration can be deployed in each environment.

Before deploying API Gateway configuration in a production environment, consult the [API Gateway Administrator Guide](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/) for information on planning and managing an API Gateway system in production.
