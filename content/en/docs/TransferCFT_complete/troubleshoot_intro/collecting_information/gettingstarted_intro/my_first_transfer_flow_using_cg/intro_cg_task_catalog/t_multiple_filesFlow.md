}Click ****Flows**** on the top toolbar to open the ****Flows / Monitoring**** page.

The following outlines tasks for defining a flow. Optional steps, such as defining source and target properties, have default values in the user interface and are not described in this getting started topic.

In the ****Flow List**** page click ****Add flow**** and perform the following steps:

1. Select **General information** and complete the fields. The following fields are mandatory (\* denotes mandatory):
    -   Name: Enter a user friendly name in our example ****Simple flow****
    -   Identifier: Enter the id that will be used in the transfer commands ****flow01**** (Transfer CFT IDF)
1. Select Source and click Edit. Define ****Store_66**** as the source in this example. The source is the owner of the data being transferred.
1. Select Target and click Edit. Define ****MainOffice**** as the ****Target**** for this example. The target is the receiver of the exchange.
1. Optionally, select Protocol and define. You cannot define a protocol until you have defined both the source and target.
1. Save the flow, or save and deploy the flow.
