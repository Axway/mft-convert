}Transfer CFT provides a set of objects that you can use to manage your
transfer security requirements.

- Certificates to
    authenticate a remote party
- TLS to secure
    a connection using the TLS protocol
- Open SSL to
    generate a local authority certificate and user certificates

You can work with certificates either via the UI or command line.
All other security operations must be performed using command lines.

This section describes the functions and components that are used to perform
security operations, and comprises a set of sub-sections that describe how to configure
and manage the Transfer CFT security objects as well as use additional {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesCompanyName  >}} products to offer security features.
