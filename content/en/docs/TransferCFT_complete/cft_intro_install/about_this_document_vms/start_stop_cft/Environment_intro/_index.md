}This section describes the standard environment created by the installation procedure that is supplied in the Transfer CFT {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentVersion  >}} VMS installation kit.

The standard {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}} environment comprises a specific directory structure, which is supplied as a model. You can modify the file organization if required.

In the supplied CFTLOGIN.COM procedure in the full installation, each directory is redefined with a logical name. Likewise, symbols enable you to navigate from one directory to another.

- The CFTLOGIN.COM procedure is located in the d$cft_run:[profile].
- The d$cft_run:[profile]CFTLOGIN.COM procedure is used to ensure compatibility with previous versions of Transfer CFT.

To simplify reading, the logical name is used in this guide.
