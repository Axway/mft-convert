  Configure and manage the Apache Cassandra database for API Gateway and API Manager.

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable distributed NO-SQL database that
provides high service availability.

Cassandra is required to store data for API Manager. You can optionally use Cassandra to store data for API Gateway components such as the Key Property Store (KPS), OAuth, and API keys.

For details on how to install the Cassandra database see [Install an Apache Cassandra database](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/cassandra_install/).
