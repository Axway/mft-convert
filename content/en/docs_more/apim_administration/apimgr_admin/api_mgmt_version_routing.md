}

API routing based on query string version enables you to host different API versions on a single base path in API Manager and to distinguish between them using a query string parameter. For example, instead of hosting your APIs on `https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/service/v1` and `https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/service/v2`, you can host them on a single base path of `https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/service.`

Then at runtime, you can specify the required API version in the URL as a query string parameter, for example:

```
https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/helloworld?v=v1
```

## Example API version-based routing scenario

In this example scenario, you have a back-end service with two versions of a simple Greeting API:

* Greeting API v1: This includes a single `GET` method named `greet` with `username` as header parameter, which returns a `hello from v1 <username>` string. For example:

    ```
    GET http:///HOSTNAME:18080/api/v1/greet
    ```

* Greeting API v2: This also includes a single `GET` method named `greet` with `username` as a query string parameter (instead of the header parameter in Greeting API v1), and which returns a `hello from v2 <username>` string. For example:

    ```
    GET http:///HOSTNAME:18080/api/v2/greet
    ```

When you import these back-end APIs into API Manager and configure API routing based on a query string version parameter, you can host both APIs on a single base path (for example, `https:///HOSTNAME:8065/api`) instead of specifying the version in each path. You can then distinguish between different versions using a query string parameter in the URL (for example, `https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/greet?v=v1`).

## Configure API version-based routing in API Manager

This section explains how to enable API routing based on a query string version parameter in API Manager. It assumes that you have already imported example back-end APIs and virtualized them as front-end APIs.

Perform the following steps in API Manager:

1. Ensure that you are logged into API Manager as an API administrator, and that the organization is enabled for API development.
2. Select **Settings** > **API Manager Settings** > **General settings** > **Enable query string version routing**. This setting enables multiple front-end APIs on the same base path to be differentiated by a query string version parameter, which you must enter in the next field.
3. In the **Query string version parameter** field, enter the required name of the query string parameter used for routing based on version (for example, `v` or `version`). For example:
    ![API routing query string version settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_api_routing_version_settings.png)
4. When query string-based version routing has been enabled, the **Query string version routing** setting is displayed when you select **API** > **Frontend API**, and view the **Inbound** tab for a selected API.
5. For each front-end API:
    1. Remove the version from the **Resource path** if necessary. For example, for Greeting API v1, you would change the default path from `api/v1` to `api`, and for Greeting API v2, change the path from `api/v2` to `api`.
    2. Enter the API version in the **Query string version routing** field instead (for example, `v1` or `v2` as appropriate). You can enter any value based your chosen versioning system (for example, major or minor version, with or without the prefix `v`).
    3. Click **Save**. The example following shows the front-end Greeting API v1:
    ![Frontend API routing based on query string version parameter](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_api_routing_version_frontend.png)
6. You can use a client test tool like Postman or curl to send a test `GET` request. For example, for Greeting API v1, with a `username` of `bob` set in the header, `https://HOSTNAME:8065/api/greet?v=v1` returns `hello from v1 bob`.

    Then for Greeting API v2, with `username` set as a query string parameter, `https:// HOSTNAME/api/greet?v=v2&username=fred` returns `hello from v2 fred`.

Finally, if you view each front-end API version in the **API Catalog**, the displayed API methods also include the query string version parameter (in this case, `v`). And if you download the generated Swagger file, the version parameter is also included.
