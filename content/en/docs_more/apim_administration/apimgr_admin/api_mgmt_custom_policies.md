## Overview of custom policies

API Manager custom policies are optional policies developed in Policy Studio that can be applied to APIs registered in API Manager. For example, these include custom policies for inbound security, request or response processing, or routing.

This topic describes the API Manager HTTP request flow, and explains the different custom policies that you can add at different stages in the flow. It also gives examples of why you would use these custom policies and explains what happens when they are executed at runtime.

### HTTP request flow

When custom policies are configured for front-end APIs in API Manager, the request flow is in the following order:

1. Client request
2. Default inbound security or optional inbound security policy
3. Optional request policy
4. Outbound authentication profile and/or default routing or optional routing policy
5. Back-end service
6. Optional response policy
7. Client response

This HTTP client request flow is shown in the following swim lane diagram:

![API Manager HTTP Request Flow](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_http_request_flow.png)

The API Manager policy flow is described as follows:

When the client makes an API call to API Manager, and the API request is first verified. If the request is not valid or not permitted, API Manager returns an HTTP error such as:

* `HTTP 400 Bad Request`
* `HTTP 404 Not Found`
* `HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed`
* `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`

When the API request has been verified, the optional custom inbound security policy is invoked if configured. This means that the default security no longer applies, and all authentication and access to the API by the API Manager organization must be provided by the custom policy. When inbound security returns `false`, API Manager returns an HTTP error such as:

* `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`
* `HTTP 403 Authentication Failed`
* `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`

If an optional request policy is configured, it could perform some customization on the client request, which is controlled by the API Manager administrator, before sending it to the routing policy.

The default routing uses a **Connect to URL** filter to route to the back-end service. If you need to customize this, you can configure an custom routing policy instead.

The client request is then routed to the back-end service.

When the response is returned from the back-end service to API Manager, if an optional response policy is configured, it processes the response and can customize it as needed before the response is returned to the client.

### Custom policy execution

The order of execution of the different custom policies is as follows:

![API Manager Custom Policy Flow](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_flow.png)

The following general rules apply when API Manager custom polices are executed:

If a filter in a custom policy is aborted, the execution flow is interrupted, and an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` is returned to the client. You can add an API Gateway **Generic Error** fault handler filter to a policy, but this will print the stack trace and the execution flow will continue to the next policies.

If a filter in a custom policy returns `false`, and there is no false flow defined in the policy, an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` is returned to the client. However, in this case, you can customize the false flow and return a custom HTTP code and error message. For example, you could use a **Set Attributes** or **Copy/Modify Attributes** filter to set the following message attributes when your request policy fails:

  ```
  request.policy.failure = true
  request.policy.httpcode = 403
  request.policy.error.msg = something happened
  ```

You can then use a custom routing policy to control processing and routing to the back-end. For example, you can test the value of the `request.policy.failure` attribute to check if the request policy succeeded, and then route to back-end. If the request policy failed, you can stop processing, and use the values from `request.policy.httpcode` and `request.policy.error.msg` to create a custom message that is reflected to the end user.

You can define API Manager fault handler policies at the API Manager, API, and method level. However, if a local fault handler is configured for any custom policies, and an exception occurs in any of these policies, the local fault handler is executed for the exception. The flow then continues as if the exception did not occur, which may not be the desired behavior. A workaround is to define a policy that acts as the fault handler using an API Gateway **Policy Shortcut** filter, and for that policy to return `false`. This ensures that any API Manager fault handler policies also get executed. For more details, see [Add API Manager fault handler policies](#add-api-manager-fault-handler-policies).

In the case of failure, an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` response code is always returned for a SOAP 1.1 response, or an `HTTP 400` and `HTTP 500` for a SOAP 1.2 response with the corresponding SOAP fault code in the SOAP response body.

### Custom policy types

These API Manager custom policies are described as follows:

#### Inbound Security Policy

Enables you to configure optional security policies to perform custom authentication for front-end APIs. API Manager provides a number of built-in authentication policies (for example, API key, OAuth, and SSL), which you can select when creating front-end APIs. You can extend the list of built-in authentication mechanisms by using the **Inbound security > Invoke policy** setting to select a custom authentication policy that has been developed in Policy Studio.

For example, you could configure a custom authentication policy that uses CA SiteMinder to authenticate client requests. In addition, custom authentication policies can specify a message displayed in the API Catalog informing application developers of the authentication mechanism to use when accessing the API. By default, no inbound security policies are configured. When you configure an inbound security policy, this means that the default security no longer applies, and all authentication and access to the API by the API Manager organization must be provided by the custom policy.

The inbound security policy must set the `authentication.subject.id` message attribute to the client ID set in the external credentials of the client application, and return true for successful authentication. By default, **Invoke policy > Use client registry** specifies that `authentication.subject.id` must match one of the application's external credentials in the API Manager client registry. This setting is also required for API Manager to check if the organization has access to the API. If you do not select this setting, the API will have no client information, and API Manager will not check the organization access.

Custom policies developed for inbound security must always end on `true` or `false`. Returning `true` means successful authentication, and returning `false` means failed authentication. In this way, these policies behave like API Gateway Policy Shortcut filters, where the result is passed back to the calling policy and handled there.

#### Global Request Policy

Enables you to configure optional global enforcement policies for front-end APIs (for example, security, compliance, or governance policies executed as part of every API call). By default, no global policies are configured.

When global request policies have been configured in Policy Studio, the API administrator can select a global request policy on the API Manager settings page. The selected global request policy is executed after inbound security but before any request, routing, or response policies configured for the front-end API.

#### Request Policy

Enables you to configure optional request processing policies for front-end APIs. For example, you could use a configured policy to check request messages for authentication or authorization. By default, no request policies are configured.

When request policies have been configured in Policy Studio, you can then apply them in API Manager on the **Frontend API > Outbound > Advanced** page. The selected request policy is executed after inbound security and any global request policy, but before any routing or response policies configured for the front-end API.

#### Routing Policy

Enables you to configure custom routing policies for front-end APIs. For example, you could use a configured policy to route to a specific back-end JMS service. By default, no routing policies are configured, and a default routing policy template is used.

When routing policies have been configured in Policy Studio, you can then apply them in API Manager on the **Frontend API > Outbound > Advanced** page. The selected routing policy is executed after any request policy and before any response policy configured for the front-end API.

#### Response Policy

Enables you to configure optional response processing policies for front-end APIs. For example, you could use a configured policy to validate or transform outbound response messages. By default, no response policies are configured.

When response policies have been configured in Policy Studio, you can then apply them in API Manager on the **Frontend API > Outbound > Advanced** page. The selected response policy is executed after any routing policy configured for the front-end API, but before any global response policy.

#### Global Response Policy

Enables you to configure optional global enforcement policies for front-end APIs (for example, security, compliance, or governance policies executed as part of every API call). By default, no global response policies are configured.

When global response policies have been configured in Policy Studio, the API administrator can select a global response policy on the API Manager settings page. The selected global response policy is executed last after any response policy configured for the front-end API.

#### Fault Handler Policy

Enables you to configure optional fault handler policies that are applied to front-end API invocations. The configured fault handler is executed when an error or exception occurs during the API Manager runtime API invocation. The API Manager Default Fault Handler policy is configured by default.

When fault handler policies are configured, an API administrator can select a global fault handler policy for all front-end APIs on the API Manager settings page. API developers can also select fault handler policies for specific front-end APIs and API methods on the **Frontend API > Outbound > Advanced** page.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}These custom policies apply to APIs registered using API Manager only, and do not apply to policies registered using Policy Studio. These custom policies enable policy developers to implement enterprise-specific policies in Policy Studio that can be applied to multiple APIs in API Manager.{{< /alert >}}

## Add custom API Manager routing policies

This section explains advanced uses cases of how to configure custom API Manager routing policies. API Manager custom routing policies support all outbound API authentication profiles configured in API Manager (for example, HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, API key, OAuth, and SSL). This topic shows detailed examples of using API key, OAuth, and SSL as the outbound authentication profile.

### API Manager custom routing policy templates

API Manager provides reserved routing policy templates in Policy Studio under **Policies** > **Generated Policies** > **REST APIs** > **Templates**. For any customization, you should make copies of these reserved templates, which may be changed in future releases:

* **Default API Proxy Routing**: API Manager custom routing is based on this template by default.
* **Default Profile-based Routing**: This is used by the **Default API Proxy Routing** template to process the following outbound authentication profiles:

    * Pass through
    * HTTP Basic
    * HTTP Digest
    * API Key
* **Default OAuth-based Routing**: This is used by the **Default API Proxy Routing** template to process the OAuth authentication profile.
* **Default SSL-based Routing**: This is used by the **Default API Proxy Routing** template to process the SSL authentication profile.
* **Default URL-based Routing**: This is used by API Gateway only since version 7.6.2.

#### Customize a template policy

You can customize a default routing policy by modifying its **Connect To URL** filter in Policy Studio. To edit a default policy, select **Policies > Generated Policies > REST APIs > Templates > My Default Routing Policy**, and double-click the **Connect to URL** filter in the policy canvas on the right.

For example, under **Settings > Failure > Call connection policy on failure**, you could configure a custom policy with a **Reflect** message filter that modifies the default `HTTP 500` response code to `HTTP 503` when the API Manager runtime cannot connect to a back-end service.

Updating a default routing policy modifies how API Manager manages connection failures globally for all APIs, without needing to modify each API.

After updating a default routing policy, you do not need to restart the underlying API Gateway, redeploying the updated configuration is sufficient.

#### Message attributes

The API Manager custom routing policy message whiteboard includes the following message attributes:

* `params.out` contains the API authentication profile for the policy customization.
* `params.authn` contains the connection handler to be consumed by the **Connect To URL** filter in the custom routing policy. To use the authentication handler, the `${params.authn}` value must be set in the required credential profile in the **Connect To URL** filter.
* Additional message attributes are also set depending on the authentication profile used. For example, these include `params.ssl.cacertificates` for SSL, and `oauth.token.id` and `oauth.client.application` for OAuth

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}API Manager custom routing policies designed for outbound SSL authentication profiles must include a **Connect To URL** filter named `apimanager.outbound.ssl`. The corresponding SSL profile settings will apply only to such **Connect To URL** filters. For example, see the **Default SSL-based Routing** template policy. {{< /alert >}}

#### Default TLS settings

The **Connect To URL** filters in the custom routing templates use TLS version 1.2 with strong FIPS-compliant ciphers by default for SSL/TLS connections. You can modify the SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers in custom routing policies as needed.

### Add a custom routing policy with API key authentication

This section explains how to set up a custom API Manager routing policy that uses API key as the outbound authentication type. It shows how to create the policy in Policy Studio, and how to configure it for use in API Manager.

#### Create the custom API key routing policy in Policy Studio

You must first create a new policy in Policy Studio that will be used as the custom API key routing policy in API Manager.

Perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the **Policies** node in the tree, and select **Add Policy**.
2. Enter a meaningful **Name** for the new policy (for example, **Custom routing policy for PetStore API**).
3. Click the new policy in the tree to start configuring its filters. You can do this by dragging the required filters from the filter palette on the right, and dropping them on to the policy canvas. This example includes **Trace** and **Connect to URL** filters:

    ![Create custom routing policy for API key](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_create.png)

4. Open the **Connect to URL** filter, and in the **URL** field, enter `${destinationURL}`.
5. On the **Authentication** tab, the client credential is set to the `${params.authn}` selector by default, but you can enter a different selector or select a credential profile if necessary:

    ![Connect to URL with Authentication set to selector](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_authn_tab.png)

#### Configure the list of API Manager routing policies in Policy Studio

You must add the new custom API key routing policy to the list of available routing policies that APIs registered in API Manager can use.

Perform the following steps:

1. Select **Server Settings** in the tree, and select **API Manager** > **Routing Policies**.
2. Click **Add** on the right, and select the custom routing policy that you created (for example, **Custom routing policy for PetStore API**).
3. Click **OK**, and click **Save** at the bottom right.

    ![Configure an API Manager routing policy](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure.png)

#### Configure the custom API key routing policy in API Manager

When the custom routing policy has been added to the list of available routing policies in Policy Studio, perform the following steps in API Manager:

1. Click **API** > **Backend** > **New API** to import a back-end API, and ensure the **Base path URL** is set to the API on the remote server.
2. Click **API** > **Frontend** > **New API** to create a front-end virtualized API from the back-end API.
3. On the **Inbound** tab, set **Inbound security** to **Pass Through**.
4. On the **Outbound** tab , set **Outbound authentication profile** to **API Key**, click **Edit** and configure the following settings:

   * **API key field name**: Use the default value of `KeyId`.
   * **API key**: Enter the API key for your API.
   * **Pass credentials as HTTP**: Select **Header** from the list.

    ![Configure API key authentication in API Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_api_key.png)

5. Click **Advanced** on the right, and set **Default method routing** to use your custom routing policy. For example:

    ![Configure custom routing policy in API Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_apimgr.png)

#### Invoke the registered API and view the API key in the request

You can now invoke the API registered in API Manager and view that the API key header is specified in the outbound request and that a successful response is returned. The following example in the API Gateway Manager web console shows the **KeyId** in the request at the bottom left:

![Invoke API and view API key in header](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_monitor_api_key.png)

### Add a custom routing policy with OAuth authentication

This section describes how to use API Manager to invoke an API with outbound OAuth authentication using a custom routing policy. In this scenario, one API Gateway instance acts as an OAuth client and the other API Gateway instance acts as an OAuth server. This section shows how to configure both API Gateway instances appropriately using the Client Credentials OAuth flow.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}This section assumes that you are already familiar with the Client Credentials OAuth flow.{{< /alert >}}

#### Configure the remote API Gateway as OAuth server in API Manager

To configure a remote API Gateway instance to act as an OAuth server, perform the following steps in API Manager:

1. Click **Clients** > **Applications** > **New application**.
2. On the **Authentication** tab, under **OAuth Credentials**, click **New client ID** > **Create**, and use the default settings:

    ![Create new OAuth credentials for API Manager application](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_credentials.png)

3. Click **API** > **Backend** > **New API** to import a back-end API.
4. Click **API** > **Frontend** > **New API** to create a front-end virtualized API from the back-end API.
5. Set the **Inbound security** to **OAuth**. This example uses the default setting to obtain the access token from the header:

    ![API Manager OAuth authorization settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_authz.png)

    You must select an OAuth access token store on the **General** tab.
6. Click **Clients** > **Applications** > **API Access** > **Add API** to add the virtualized front-end API to the list of APIs that the application can access.
7. Click **Settings** > **API Manager Settings** >**General settings**, and ensure that **Enable OAuth scopes per application** is set.
8. Click **Clients** > **Applications** > **Authentication** > **OAuth Scopes** > **Add scopes**, and select the **resource.READ** and **resource.WRITE** scopes:
    ![Scope settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_scopes.png)

    You may need to refresh your browser if **OAuth Scopes** are not displayed.

#### Configure the client credentials in Policy Studio

When using the Client Credentials OAuth flow for the client, you must first configure the client credentials correctly in Policy Studio. This ensures that the client can request an OAuth access token using only its client credentials and that the authorization is specified in the header as expected.

Perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Policies** > **OAuth 2.0** > **Access Token Service** > **Client Credentials**.
2. Right-click the **Access Token using client credentials** filter, and select **Edit**.
3. On the **Application Validation** tab, select the **In Authorization Header** option:

![Configure OAuth Client Credentials in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_client_credentials.png)

#### Configure the local API Gateway as OAuth client in Policy Studio

To configure a local API Gateway instance to act as an OAuth client, perform the following steps:

1. To create an OAuth2 credentials application using the Client Credentials flow, select **Environment Configuration** > **External Connections** > **Client Credentials** > **OAuth2**, right-click and select **Add OAuth2 Client Credential**.
2. Click **Add OAuth2 Application Settings** on the right, and ensure the following settings are configured:

   * Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that were generated on the remote API Gateway instance.
   * Select an **OAuth Flow Type** of **Client Credentials**.
   * On the **Scopes** tab, click **Add** to add the **resource.READ** and **resource.WRITE** scopes.

    ![Configure OAuth2 Application Settings in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_client_credentials_app.png)
3. On the **Advanced** tab, you must also ensure that **In Authorization Header** is selected for the location of the client ID and client secret:

    ![Configure Advanced OAuth2 Application Settings in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_client_credentials_app_adv.png)

4. Click **Save** on the right to save the application.
5. On the **OAuth2 Provider Settings** tab, enter the IP address of the remote instance in the **Authorization Endpoint** and **Token Endpoint**:

    ![OAuth provider settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_oauth_provider_settings.png)

#### Create the custom OAuth routing policy in Policy Studio\

To create a new policy to use as the custom OAuth routing policy in API Manager, perform the following steps in Policy Studio:

1. Right-click the **Policies** node in the tree, and select **Add Policy**.
2. Enter a meaningful **Name** for the new policy (for example, **Custom routing policy with OAuth**).
3. Click the new policy in the tree to start configuring the filters for this policy. You can do this by dragging the required filters from the filter palette on the right, and dropping them on to the policy canvas. This example includes **Get OAuth Access Token** and **Connect to URL** filters:
    ![Create custom routing policy using OAuth in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_create_oauth.png)
4. In the **Get OAuth Access Token** filter, the client credentials profile is obtained from the message whiteboard by default, so the token should now be available.
5. Open the **Connect to URL** filter, and in the **URL** field, enter `${destinationURL}`.
6. On the **Authentication** tab, the client credential is set to the `${params.authn}` selector by default, but you can enter a different selector or select a credential profile if necessary:

    ![Connect to URL with Authentication set to selector](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_authn_tab.png)

#### Configure the list of API Manager routing policies and OAuth outbound credentials in Policy Studio

You must add the new custom routing policy and OAuth credentials to the lists of available routing policies and credentials that APIs registered in API Manager can use.

Perform the following steps:

1. Select **Server Settings** in the tree, and select **API Manager** > **Routing Policies**.
2. Click **Add** on the right, and select the custom routing policy that you created (for example, **Custom routing policy with OAuth**).
3. Select **API Manager** > **OAuth Outbound Credentials**.
4. Click **Add** on the right, and select the OAuth client credentials that you created (for example, **Test OAuth**).
5. Click **OK**, and click **Save** at the bottom right.

    ![Configure API Manager OAuth Outbound Credentials in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_oauth.png)

#### Configure the custom OAuth routing policy in API Manager

When the custom routing policy and OAuth outbound credentials have been added in Policy Studio, perform the following steps in API Manager:

1. Click **API** > **Backend** > **New API** to import a back-end API, and ensure the **Base path URL** is set to the API on the remote server.
2. Click **API** > **Frontend** > **New API** to create a front-end virtualized API from the back-end API.
3. On the **Inbound** tab, set the **Inbound security** to **Pass Through**.
4. On the **Outbound** tab, set the **Outbound authentication profile** to **OAuth**, and configure the following:

   * **Provider profile**: Enter the OAuth outbound credentials profile that you created in Policy Studio (for example, **Test OAuth**).
   * **Token Key (Owner ID)**: Use the default `${authentication.subject.id}` selector setting to obtain this value.
5. Click **Advanced** at the top right, and set the **Default method routing** to use your custom routing policy. For example:

![Configure the OAuth custom routing policy in API Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_apimgr_oauth.png)

#### Invoke the registered API with OAuth authorization header in request

You can now invoke the API registered in API Manager and view that the authorization header is specified in the outbound request and that a successful response is returned. The following example in the API Gateway Manager web console shows the OAuth custom routing policy in the execution path:

![OAuth custom routing policy displayed in API Gateway Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_monitor_oauth.png)

The following example shows the **Authorization** `Bearer` header correctly displayed in the request in the bottom panel in API Gateway Manager:

![ Authorization Bearer header displayed in API Gateway Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_monitor_oauth_header.png)

### Add a custom routing policy with SSL authentication

This section explains how to configure mutual authentication using a custom API Manager routing policy with SSL as the outbound authentication type. It first shows how to configure the back-end SSL server for mutual authentication, and then shows how to create the custom policy in Policy Studio and how to configure this policy in API Manager.

#### Set up the back-end SSL server for mutual authentication

You must first configure the certificates for the SSL server and client, and then create an HTTPS interface:

##### Create a certificate for the SSL server

1. Ensure that your SSL certificate has been created and imported into the API Gateway certificate store. In Policy Studio, select **Environment Configuration** > **Certifcates and Keys** > **Certifcates** > **Create/Import**.
2. On the **Configure Certificate and Private Key** dialog, click **Edit** to configure the distinguished name. For example:
   ![Configure SSL Certficate and Private Key](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_ssl_dname.png)
3. Select the validity dates, and click **Use Subject**.
4. Click **Sign Certificate** to create the certificate and keys.

##### Export the client certificate and key

1. To select the client certificate that you wish to export, select **Environment Configuration** > **Certifcates and Keys** > **Certificates**, select the certificate, and click **Edit**.
2. Click **Export Certificate + Key** to set a password and export your SSL client certificate (`.p12` file). You will add this certificate to the list of certificates you trust when creating your HTTPS interface.

##### Create an HTTPS interface

1. Select **Environment Configuration** > **API Gateway** > **Listeners** > **Default Services** > **Ports**.
2. Click **Add** > **HTTPS Interface** on the right, and configure the tabs as follows:

   * **Network**: Click **X.509 Certificate** and select the certificate that you created.
   * **Mutual Authentication**: Select **Requires client certificate**, and select the **Root Certificate Authorities trusted for mutual authentication**.
   * **Traffic Monitor**: Use the default settings.
   * **Advanced**: Use the default settings.
   * **Advanced (SSL)**: You must deselect **Check that the SLL certificate's Subject CN resolves to network address**. You can use the defaults for the other settings, for example:

   ![Configure HTTPS Interface - Advanced (SSL) Settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_https_adv_settings.png)

#### Create the custom SSL routing policy in Policy Studio

You must create a new policy in Policy Studio that will be used as the custom routing policy in API Manager.

Perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the **Policies** node in the tree, and select **Add Policy**.
2. Enter a meaningful **Name** for the new policy (for example, **Custom SSL routing policy**).
3. Click the new policy in the tree to start configuring its filters. You can do this by dragging the required filters from the filter palette on the right, and dropping them on to the policy canvas. You must include a **Connect to URL** filter for SSL:

    ![Create Custom Routing Policy for SSL](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_create_ssl.png)

4. In the **Connect to URL** filter, you must enter a **Name** of `apimanager.outbound.ssl`, which is only used for API Manager.
5. In the **URL** field, enter `${destinationURL}`.
6. On the **SSL** > **Advanced (SSL)** tab specifies TLS version 1.2 with strong FIPS-compliant ciphers by default for SSL/TLS connections, but you can modify these settings to suit your requirements.
7. On the **Authentication** tab, the client credential is not set by default.

    ![Connect to URL with SSL settings](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_ssl_tab.png)

#### Add the custom SSL routing policy to Policy Studio

You must add the new custom SSL routing policy to the list of available routing policies that APIs registered in API Manager can use.

Perform the following steps:

1. Select **Server Settings** in the tree, and select **API Manager** > **Routing Policies**.
2. Click **Add** on the right, and select the custom routing policy that you created (for example, **Custom SSL Routing Policy**).
3. Click **OK**, and click **Save** at the bottom right.

    ![Configure a Custom SSL Routing Policy](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_ssl.png)

#### Configure the custom SSL routing policy in API Manager

When the custom routing policy has been added to the list of available routing policies in Policy Studio, perform the following steps in API Manager:

1. Click **API** > **Backend** > **New API** to import a back-end API, and ensure the **Base path URL** is set to the host and port of your SSL server..
2. On the **API Methods** tab, add a method for testing purposes (for example, `healthcheck`).
3. Click **API** > **Frontend** > **New API** to create a front-end virtualized API from the back-end API..
4. On the **Inbound** tab, set **Inbound security** to **Pass Through**.
5. On the **Trusted Certificates** tab, click the **+** sign and import the SSL server certificate.
6. On the **Authentication Profiles** tab, click the **+** sign, select **SSL** to specify the **PFX/P12 file** for the SSL client certificate and enter the password.
7. On the **Outbound** tab, set **Outbound authentication profile** to **SSL**, click **Edit**, and configure the following settings:

   * **PFX/P12 file**: Select the SSL client certificate
   * **PFX/P12 password**: Enter the password for the SSL client certificate.
   * **Trust all certificates in chain**: Ensure this setting is selected.

    ![Configure SSL Authentication in API Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_apimgr_ssl.png)
8. Click **Advanced** on the right, and set **Default method routing** to use your custom SSL routing policy. For example:

    ![Configure custom SSL routing policy in API Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_configure_apimgr_ssl_policy.png)

#### Invoke the registered API and test SSL authentication

You can now invoke the API registered in API Manager and view that the SSL Two-way authentication works correctly. The following example shows using the **Try Method** feature on the **API Methods** tab to test with a `healthcheck` method:

![Invoke API and test SSL mutual authentication](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_test_ssl.png)

You may need to configure your localhost and port in **API Manager settings > API Registration > API default virtual host**. For example:

![Test SSL authentication](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_custom_policy_test_ssl_settings.png)

## Enforce API Manager global policies

Use API Manager to apply mandatory security, compliance, or governance policies, which are executed as part of every API call across your entire API portfolio.

Global enforcement of policies enables API administrators to configure global request and response policies that are executed for every virtualized API method invocation. You can achieve this as follows:

* In Policy Studio, as a policy developer, you must first configure your chosen policies as API Manager global request and response policies, which are then displayed in API Manager on the API Manager settings page.
* In API Manager, as an API administrator, select a global request policy and a global response policy from the list of available global policies.

API Manager global request and global response policies are both optional features, and you can configure one without the other, or neither, depending on your requirements.

### API Manager global policy flow

Configuring global policies in API Manager extends the policy execution path for front-end APIs as follows:

![API Manager Global Policy Flow](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_policy_flow.png)

In this policy flow, all policies are optional, and the global policies are executed as follows:

* The global request policy is executed after inbound authentication but before any non-global request, routing, or response policies configured for the front-end API.
* The global response policy is executed last after any non-global response policy configured for the front-end API.

For details on configuring non-global request, routing, and response policies, see [Configure API Manager settings in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_config_ps/).

### Configure API Manager global policies in Policy Studio

You must first configure API Manager global request and response policies in Policy Studio before you can apply them in API Manager.

#### Configure global request policies

To configure API Manager global request policies, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings** > **API Manager** > **Global Request Policies**.
2. Click **Add**, and select policies in the dialog. By default, no global request policies are configured.
3. Click **Save** at the bottom right.
4. Click the **Deploy** button at the right of the toolbar to deploy the configuration to the API Gateway.

![Configure API Manager Global Request Policies in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_request_policy_config.png)

#### Configure global response policies

To configure API Manager global response policies, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings** > **API Manager** > **Global Response Policies**.
2. Click **Add**, and select policies in the dialog. By default, no global response policies are configured.
3. Click **Save** at the bottom right.

![Configure API Manager Global Response Policies in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_response_policy_config.png)

### Select global policies in API Manager

When API Manager global request and response policies are configured in Policy Studio, the API administrator can select the available policies in API Manager on the **Settings** > **API Manager settings** page.

![Apply an API Manager Global Policy](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_policy_apply.png)

To apply API Manager global policies, perform the following steps:

1. In API Manager, under **Settings** > **API Manager settings** > **Global Policies**, select **Enable Global Policies**. This setting is disabled by default.
2. Select a global policy from the **Global Request Policy** list (for example, a corporate security policy).
3. Select a global policy from the **Global Response Policy** list (for example, a corporate governance policy).

When global policies have been selected by the API administrator, they are then displayed for all APIs on the **Frontend API** > **Outbound** tab when you click **Advanced** (in the read-only **Global request policy** and **Global response policy** fields). For example:

![API Manager Global Policy Selected for Front-end API](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_policy_frontend.png)

### API transaction analysis in API Gateway Manager

When a global policy is selected in API Manager, it is also displayed for all API runtime invocations in the API Gateway Manager console in the **Filter Execution Path** on the **Traffic** page. The following example shows both global request and response policies:

![API Manager Global Policy in API Gateway Manager](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_global_policy_monitor.png)

### Export of API collections with global policies

Global policies configured in API Manager are not exported as part of the API collection. This is because global policies are part of the API Manager system settings only. When a global policy is selected, it is displayed as being executed on the **Frontend API** > **Outbound** > **Advanced** tab.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}When moving API collections to upstream environments (for example, from Test to Pre-production to Production), and global policies are configured in Policy Studio, the global policies must be enabled in API Manager and must be available in those upstream environments. These steps must be performed out-of-band of any export or import of API collections.{{< /alert >}}

## Add API Manager fault handler policies

Use API Manager to add a fault handler policy at the global, API, and API method level. The configured fault handler is then executed when an error or exception occurs during the API Manager runtime API invocation.

You can enable fault handler policies in API Manager as follows:

* Policy developers can configure policies in Policy Studio as API Manager fault handler policies, which are then displayed in API Manager.
* API administrators can enable and configure a global API Manager fault handler policy that is executed when an error occurs for all virtualized API methods.
* API developers can configure specific fault handler policies at the front-end API and method levels, which override any other fault handler policies that are configured.

API Manager fault handler policies are optional features that you can configure depending on your requirements.

### API Manager fault handler template

API Manager provides a fault handler template, which acts as the default fault handler for an API Manager instance. This simple fault handler policy consists of an API Gateway **Generic Error** filter:

![API Manager default fault handler](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_fault_handler_default.png)

### When API Manager fault handlers are executed

API Manager fault handlers are switched off in a vanilla API Manager installation. However, the API Manager default fault handler policy is configured and selected. This maintains existing functionality post-installation or upgrade, and also makes the transition to employing API Manager fault handlers a simple toggle of a button.

You can configure fault handlers at the following levels:

| Fault Handler       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Global              | System global fault handler, configured using Policy Studio. This is existing functionality (pre-version 7.6.2) for all API Manager instances.                                                                           |
| API Manager default | Configured for a specific API Manager instance by the API administrator. This fault handler acts as the default for all virtualized APIs, and overrides any fault handler configured at the global level.                |
| API                 | Configured for a specific front-end API (in the **Outbound** > **Advanced** view). This fault handler overrides any fault handler configured at the API Manager default or global levels.                                |
| API method          | Configured for a specific front-end API as a per-method override (in the **Outbound** > **Advanced** view). This fault handler overrides any fault handler configured at the API, API Manager instance, or global level. |

### Configure API Manager fault handler policies in Policy Studio

You must first configure API Manager fault handler policies in Policy Studio before you can apply them in API Manager at the API Manager default, API, or API method levels.

#### Configure fault handler policies

To configure API Manager fault handler policies, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings** > **API Manager** > **Fault Handler Policies**.
2. Click **Add**, and select policies in the dialog. The API Manager **Default Fault Handler** policy is configured by default.
3. Click **Save** at the bottom right.
4. Click the **Deploy** button at the right of the toolbar to deploy the configuration to the API Gateway.

![Configure API Manager Fault Handler Policies in Policy Studio](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_fault_handler_config_ps.png)

### Enable fault handlers and select a global fault handler in API Manager

When API Manager fault handler policies are configured in Policy Studio, the API administrator can enable this feature and select a global fault handler from the available policies in on the **Settings** > **API Manager settings** page.

![Apply an API Manager Global Fault Handler Policy](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_fault_handler_global.png)

To enable fault handlers and select a global API Manager fault handler policy, perform the following steps:

1. In API Manager, under **Settings** > **API Manager settings** > **Fault Handlers**, select **Enable API Manager fault handlers**. This setting is switched off by default.
2. Select a policy from the **Global Fault Handler Policy** list. This setting defaults to the **Default Fault Handler** policy.

### Select API and API method fault handler policies in API Manager

When API Manager fault handler policies have been enabled by the API administrator, you can then also select API and API method-level fault handler policies for a front-end API.

#### Select an API-level fault handler policy

To select a fault handler policy for a specific front-end API, perform the following steps:

1. In API Manager, select **Frontend API** > **Outbound**, and click **Advanced** at the top right.
2. Select a policy for this front-end API from the **Fault Handler Policy** list.
3. Click **Save** at the top left.

For example:

![API Manager Fault Handler Policy for Frontend API](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_fault_handler_api.png)

#### Select an API method-level fault handler policy

To select a fault handler policy for a specific front-end API method, perform the following steps:

1. In API Manager, select **Frontend API** > **Outbound**, and click **Advanced** at the top right.
2. Under **PER-METHOD OVERRIDE**, click the plus sign (**+**) to add an API method.
3. Select a policy for this front-end API method from the **FAULT HANDLER POLICY** list.
4. Click **Save** at the top left.

For example:

![API Manager Fault Handler Policy for Frontend API Method](/Images/docbook/images/api_mgmt/api_mgmt_fault_handler_api_method.png)

### Tips and tricks

* When editing a front-end API, to enable fault handlers, perform the following steps:

  1. Remain in edit mode on the front-end API.
  2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **API Manager settings** page.
  3. Switch on the **Enable API Manager fault handlers** setting.
  4. Navigate back to the front-end API (notice that the **Apply** button at the top left is now enabled).
  5. Click **Apply** so that API Manager is updated to reflect the system configuration change.
  6. You should now be able to select a fault handler for your front-end API.
* To output a complete list of attributes available to the fault handler, add a **Trace** filter to your fault handler policy. Not all attributes are available for every API invocation, depending whether authentication is performed, the error that occurs, where the error originates, and so on.

#### Order of precedence of fault handlers

* When you have switched on the fault handler feature, because the **Default Fault Handler** policy is pre-selected in API Manager, there is no need to select the same fault handler at the API level. If an error occurs, the **Default Fault Handler** is invoked.
* If a **Global Fault Handler Policy** is configured in API Manager, and the API Manager fault handler feature is switched off, this policy is executed when an error or exception occurs in the API Manager policy flow. This does not apply when a successful connection is made to the back-end, and the server responds with a non-`2xx` response. In this case, no exception handler is invoked.
* If API Manager fault handlers are enabled and an API Gateway global fault handler policy is configured, and then an exception occurs in the API Manager fault handler (global, API, or method-level), both the API Manager fault handler and API Gateway global fault handler are executed. The API Manager fault handler is executed first, followed by the API Gateway global fault handler.
* If a local fault handler is configured for any custom API Manager policies (global request, request, routing, response, or global response), and an exception occurs in any of these policies, the local fault handler is executed for the exception. The flow then continues as if the exception never occurred, which may not be the desired behavior.

    A workaround is to define a policy that acts as the fault handler (using an API Gateway **Policy Shortcut** filter), and for that policy to return `false`. This ensures that the API Manager fault handler (global, API, or method-level) also gets executed.

### Export of API collections with fault handler policies

Fault handler policies configured in API Manager are not exported as part of the API collection in the same way that custom request, routing, or response policies are not exported. The exported API collection only contains references to any configured fault handler policies. The policies themselves remain in the API Manager configuration.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}When moving API collections to upstream environments (for example, from Test to Pre-production to Production), and fault handler policies are configured in Policy Studio, the fault handler policies must be deployed before the API collection is imported.{{< /alert >}}

### Fault handler generated errors

The following tables describe the circumstances under which fault handlers configured in API Manager are executed.

#### API Manager generated errors

An `api.error.reason` message attribute is added to the message whiteboard prior to the fault handler policy being executed, so that users can make decisions on the reasons of the error being processed. This attribute is in `java.lang.String` format.

The following errors are generated by the API Manager default fault handler:

| Error                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### Policy generated errors

The following errors are generated by any custom policies configure in API Manager:

| Error                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Back-end generated errors

The following errors are generated by the back-end API service.

| Error | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `3xx` | Back-end service has responded with a redirect. Technically, redirects are not errors, but some users may wish to perform additional processing of the response in the fault handler policy. If you have enabled the fault handler feature, but do not consider `3xx` responses as errors, you must add specific logic to your fault handler policies. |
| `4xx` | Back-end service has responded with a client error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `5xx` | Back-end service has responded with a server error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Fault handler message attributes

An `api.error.source` message attribute is added to the message whiteboard prior to the fault handler policy being executed, so that users can make decisions on the source of the error being processed. This attribute is in `java.lang.String` format.

The possible values for this attribute are:

| Error        | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiManager` | The error was generated by the API Manager runtime.                                          |
| `backend`    | The error was generated by the back-end service by returning a status code other than `2xx`. |
