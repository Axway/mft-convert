{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
Running API Gateway in FIPS mode is not supported in API Gateway 7.7 Mar20 update or later. In the Mar20 update OpenSSL has been upgraded to OpenSSL 1.1.1, as OpenSSL 1.0.2 is EOL. OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not support FIPS. OpenSSL 3.0 (when available) will support FIPS.

API Gateway supports Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). When running an API Gateway instance or a Policy Studio client in FIPS mode, the following FIPS-certified cryptographic modules are enabled and invoked for all FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms:

| Cryptographic Module                                          | FIPS 140-2 Certificate Number |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Entrust Authority Security Toolkit for the Java Platform v8.0 | 1839                          |
| OpenSSL FIPS Object Module                                    | 1747                          |

Running API Gateway in FIPS mode is a separately licensed option that must be specifically ordered. For more details, contact your Axway sales representative.

## Enable FIPS mode for an API Gateway

You can use the `togglefips` script to enable or disable FIPS mode for a gateway instance.

* You can run this script only with a FIPS-enabled API Gateway license.
* You must restart any Node Manager or API Gateway instances after running the `togglefips` script.
* To enable FIPS in a multi-node domain you must run `togglefips --enable` on all nodes in the domain, and all API Gateway processes must be restarted.

Run the following commands:

```
> cd apigateway/posix/bin
> ./togglefips --enable | -e
> ./togglefips --disable | -d
```

### Enable or disable FIPS on Windows

Run the following commands:

```
> cd apigateway\Win32\bin
> togglefips.bat --enable | -e
> togglefips.bat --disable | -d
```

## Enable FIPS mode for Policy Studio

You can also enable FIPS mode for a Policy Studio client application only. To enable or disable FIPS mode in Policy Studio, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Preferences > IPS Mode**.
2. Select **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Policy Studio**.
3. Restart Policy Studio with the `clean` option as follows:

```
policystudio -clean
```

You can use the same instructions to enable FIPS in Configuration Studio.

## Restrictions when running in FIPS mode

When running in FIPS mode, certain gateway features are not enabled because they depend on non-FIPS compliant algorithms.

The following features cannot be run when the gateway is running in FIPS mode:

* HTTP digest authentication filter
* Kerberos authentication where MD5, DES, and other non-FIPS compliant algorithms are used

For a complete list of non-FIPS compliant algorithms and cipher suites configured in all crypto-related filters and interfaces in Policy Studio, select **Tools > Check Security Constraints > FIPS**, and view the output on the pane on the right.
