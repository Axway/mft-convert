}

You can configure API Gateway log and event default settings in **Server Settings** in Policy Studio, and you can use the API Gateway Manager web console **Settings > Dynamic** tab to configure the log settings at runtime.

Also, you can use the **Logs** and **Events** views in the API Gateway Manager web console to view and search API Gateway log and event files.

The **Logs** view displays the following API Gateway logs for message transactions, domain management and runtime diagnostics:

* **Domain Audit**: Displays management changes at the API Gateway domain level (such as updates to API Gateway configuration, topology, login, or deployment). The domain audit log is configured by default. For more details, see [Configure audit logs per domain](#configure-audit-logs-per-domain).
* **Transaction Audit**: Records policy-level message transaction log entries generated by each filter as the message passes through the filter. You can define the transaction audit log output for each filter in Policy Studio (for example, success, failure, or abort filters), and configure different log output destinations. For more details, see [Transaction audit log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-audit-log-settings).
* **Transaction Access**: Provides a summary of HTTP request and response message transactions in Apache HTTP Server format. You can configure the access log per API Gateway path. For more details, see [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-access-log-settings).
* **Trace**: Records detailed diagnostic and debugging information on API Gateway instance execution (such as services starting or stopping, or messages sent through the API Gateway). The trace log is configured by default. Include trace log files in your Support query when raising issues with Axway Support. For more details, see [Configure API Gateway diagnostic trace](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/tracing/).  This data can be redacted to remove sensitive information, as discussed in [Hide sensitive data](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/admin_redactors/).

The **Events** view displays in-memory events for transaction audit logs, system alerts, and SLA alerts. For more details, see [Manage API Gateway events and alerts](#manage-api-gateway-events-and-alerts).

## Configure audit logs per domain

The domain audit log captures management changes in the API Gateway domain that are written by Node Managers and by API Gateway instances.

This includes details such as API Gateway configuration changes, log in or log out, deployments, user, or topology changes. For example, user Joe deployed a new configuration, admin user created a new group, or user Jane has read deployment data.

The domain audit log is enabled by default. You can configure options such as the number of events displayed, time interval, and event type.

### View domain audit log events in API Gateway Manager

To view domain audit log events in the API Gateway Manager web console, perform the following steps:

1. In the API Gateway Manager, select **Logs > Domain Audit**.
2. Configure the number of events displayed in the **Max results per server** field on the left. Defaults to `1000`.
3. Configure **Time Interval** for events. Defaults to `1 day`.
4. Click the **Filter** button to add more viewing options (**Event Type** or **Groups and Servers**).
5. Click **Apply** when finished.

### View the domain audit log file

Alternatively, you can view contents of the domain audit log file. For example, the following shows the file for the Admin Node Manager:

```
<install-dir>/apigateway/logs/audit.log
```

For example:

```
{"timestamp":1397724538713,"message":"User 'admin' connected with 3 defined user roles","eventId":107,"metadata":{"userID":"admin"}}
{"timestamp":1397724539638,"message":"Deployment data read by user 'admin'","eventId":1037,"metadata":{}}
{"timestamp":1397726232992,"message":"Performing domain audit lookup for service 'Node Manager on cayote.acme.com' over a 24h interval","eventId":9,"metadata": {"userID":"admin","serviceID":"nodemanager-1"}}
{"timestamp":1397726235233,"message":"Performing domain audit lookup for service 'Node Manager on cayote.acme.com' over a 24h interval","eventId":9,"metadata": {"userID":"admin","serviceID":"nodemanager-1"}}
```

The default maximum size for the audit log file is 5 MB. A new file is created when the server instance restarts. The maximum of files stored in the `logs` directory is `50`. When this maximum number of log files is reached, the files roll over, and the oldest files are deleted. See also [Offload audit log files to an external audit server](#offload-audit-log-files-to-an-external-audit-server).

## Configure events displayed in domain audit log

To configure the set of events that are displayed in the domain audit log, perform the following steps:

1. In API Gateway Manager, select **Settings > Domain Audit Events**.
2. Select the event categories to display in the domain audit log. You can drill down in each category to select individual events. If events are not selected, they are not written to the domain audit log. For example, the available events include the following:
    * **Communication events**: Communication between the Admin Node Manager and API Gateway (connection or failure).
    * **Configuration events**: Configuration deployment started, completed, error, or rollback. Passphrase or archive update, and so on.
    * **KPS events**: Key Property Store (KPS) object created, query read, and so on.
    * **Service events**: Service started, stopped, or shutdown failed, and audit log offload or event configuration.
    * **Session events**: HTTPS and TLS session established, failed, or terminated.
    * **Topology events**: Host, group, or instance added, removed, or updated, and so on.
    * **User store events**: Admin user, role, and password policy created, updated, deleted, and so on.
3. Click **Apply** when finished.

The list of configured domain audit log events is stored on disk in the following JSON file:

```
<install-dir>/system/conf/events.json
```

### Offload audit log files to an external audit server

You can periodically offload the following audit log files to an external audit server using an HTTP `POST`:

* Domain audit log
* Transaction audit log

When you enable this feature, these log files are offloaded every 5 minutes. The files are rolled over when the scheduler runs to ensure that the records audited up to that point are offloaded. This guarantees a greater degree of synchronicity between the local and remote audit records.

To configure how the scheduler connects to the remote audit server, perform the following steps:

1. In API Gateway Manager, select **Settings > Domain Audit Settings**.
2. Configure the following settings:
    * **Enabled**: Select whether the external audit offload scheduler is enabled. This is disabled by default.
    * **Destination URL**: Enter the required HTTP URL of the external audit server. The application at this URL must be capable of processing the audit files.
    * **Username**: If the audit server requires HTTP Basic authentication, enter the user name.
    * **Password**: If HTTP Basic authentication is required, enter the password.
    * **Trusted Certificates**: Enter the list of PEM-encoded certificates that are considered trusted for the TLS connection to the remote audit server.
3. Click **Apply** when finished.

**Redact domain audit log output**:

You can also customize and redact the contents of the output in the `logs/audit.log` file. For example, for security purposes, you can redact sensitive information, such as specific query parameters that contain customer details, passwords, or credit card information. Alternatively, you can prevent the file from becoming flooded with specific messages, such as `GET` API calls for metrics.

You can use the following file to customize the output of the domain audit log file:

```
<install-dir>/apigateway/conf/apiaudit.xml
```

This file enables you to specify rules to filter out sensitive details or noisy API calls. The default file contains some predefined rules (for example, filtering out metrics). You can use this file to specify whether an entry is made to the domain audit log file, and to specify the contents of the text in the output message.

For example, the following entry specifies an `outputMessage` for all `GET` messages on the `ops/setserviceconfig` path:

```
<apiauditrule>
    <method>GET</method>
    <path>^ops/getserviceconfig$</path>
    <pathMatch>MATCHES</pathMatch>
        <query`Args>*</queryArgs>
        <outputMessage>Update configuration for service '${serviceName}'
        :${queryArgs}</outputMessage>
</apiauditrule>
```

The following example specifies no `outputMessage` for `GET` messages on the `api/monitoring/metrics` path:

```
<apiauditrule>
    <method>GET</method>
    <path>api/monitoring/metrics</path>
    <pathMatch>BEGINS_WITH</pathMatch>
</apiauditrule>
```

**Domain audit rule syntax**:

The rules in the `apiaudit.xml` file analyze the traffic passing through the API Gateway router service, and control the entries in the domain audit log. These rules are checked in the order specified in the file. The `method`, `path` and `pathMatch` elements determine whether a rule is triggered. If a rule is triggered, all subsequent rules are ignored. You should specify all rules in order of priority (for example, most sensitive or noisy first).

The domain audit rule elements are described as follows:

`method`

Required comma-separated list of HTTP methods (`GET`, `PUT`, and so on). Use the `*` wildcard to specify all methods.

`path`

Required regular expression that specifies a URL path (for example, `^api/domainaudit/search$`). Use the `*` wildcard to specify all paths.

`pathMatch`

Required path matching statement (one of the following: `MATCHES`, `BEGINS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `CONTAINS`, `DOES_NOT_CONTAIN`, `IS`, `IS_NOT`, `DOES_NOT_MATCH`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                           `queryArgs`

Option to specify query string arguments output in the log. To redact certain arguments, you must explicitly list only the arguments you wish to show in a comma-separated list. Leaving this blank or omitting the element specifies that no query arguments are displayed. The `*` wildcard specifies that all query arguments are available for printing.

`outputMessage`

Option to specify the message output printed in the log. Leaving this blank or omitting the element means that no entry is made in the domain audit log for this rule.

For more details and example rules, see the contents of the `conf/apiaudit.xml` file.

## Configure transaction audit log destinations

The API Gateway provides detailed transaction audit logging for specific message filters (for example, the request, time of the request, where the request was routed to, and response returned to the client). You can configure transaction logging output to a number of different destinations:

* Text file
* XML file
* Database
* Local syslog
* Remote syslog
* System console

Transaction audit logging is not configured by default. To configure where transaction audit log information is sent, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings > Logging > Transaction Audit Log**.
2. Specify the required settings on the appropriate tabs (for example, **Text File**, **Database**, or **XML File**).
3. When finished, click **Save** at the bottom right.
4. Click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar to deploy your settings to the API Gateway.

When a transaction audit log **Text File** destination is enabled, a text log file is written and displayed in API Gateway Manager in the **Logs > Transaction Audit** view. For details on configuring all available options, see [Transaction audit log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-audit-log-settings).

## Configure transaction audit logs per filter

You can configure the transaction audit log level and log message for a specific filter as follows:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, click any policy to display it in the canvas on the right (for example, **QuickStart > Virtualized Services > REST > GetProducts**).
2. Double-click a filter on the canvas to edit (for example, **Connect to Heroes REST Service**).
3. Click **Next** to display the **Transaction Audit Logging Level and Message** window.
4. Select **Override Logging Level for this filter**.
5. Select the log levels required for troubleshooting (for example, **Fatal** and **Failure**).
6. Enter any non-default log messages if required.
7. Click **Finish**.
8. Click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar to deploy your settings to the API Gateway.

**Message payload logging**:

You can also enable logging of the message payload in the transaction using a **Log Message Payload** filter in your policy, or by enabling dynamic payload logging in API Gateway Manager (see [Configure dynamic trace and log settings](#configure-dynamic-trace-and-log-settings)). When message payload logging is enabled, the transaction payload is logged to the transaction audit log destinations that are configured.

* **Transaction Audit Logging Level and Message** monitoring in each filter
* **Log Message Payload** filter

### Configure transaction event logs per API Gateway

The transaction event log provides a summary of each API Gateway transaction. These logs are persisted, and when configured, are used to generate metrics on the **Monitoring** tab in
API Manager, or in third-party monitoring tools such as Splunk.

Transaction event logging is enabled by default. To configure the transaction event log output, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings > Logging > Transaction Event Log**.
2. Specify the required settings (for example, directory name, max disk space, and so on).
3. When finished, click **Save** at the bottom right.
4. Click **Deploy** in the toolbar to deploy your settings to the API Gateway.

For details on configuring all the available options, see [Transaction event log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-event-log-settings).

## Configure transaction access logs per path

The access log provides summary of the HTTP request and response messages that are written to an access log file in the format used by Apache HTTP Server. For example, this includes details such as the remote hostname, user login name, and authenticated user name.

Access logging is not configured by default. To configure the access log output, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings > Logging > Transaction Access Log**.
2. Specify the required settings (for example, file name, directory name, and so on).
3. When finished, click **Save** at the bottom right.
4. You must also configure the access log at the service level on a specific relative path. In the Policy Studio tree, select the relative path, right-click it in the **Resolvers** pane, and select **Edit**.
5. Click the **Logging Settings** tab, and select **Include in server access log records**.
6. Click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar to deploy your settings to the API Gateway.

For details on configuring all the available options, see [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-access-log-settings).

## Manage API Gateway events and alerts

The **Events** view in API Gateway Manager enables you to view and search the contents of the following in-memory gateway events and alerts:

* **Transaction Audit**: When policy-level transaction audit logging is configured in API Gateway filters, this displays an in-memory list of transaction audit log events. A transaction audit log destination does not need to be enabled for the in-memory list of events to be updated. For more details, see [Transaction audit log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-audit-log-settings).
* **Alerts**: When system **Alert** filters are configured in your policies, this displays an in-memory list of alert events. An alert destination does not need to be enabled for in-memory list of events to be updated.
* **SLA Alerts**: When **SLA Alert** filters are configured in your policies, this displays an in-memory list of Service Level Agreement (SLA) alert events. An alert destination does not need to be enabled for in-memory list of events to be updated.

## Configure dynamic trace and log settings

You can click the **Settings > Dynamic** tab in API Gateway Manager to configure dynamic trace, logging, and monitoring settings on-the-fly at runtime. These settings are dynamic because you do not need to refresh or deploy updates to the API Gateway. You can specify these settings for an API Gateway system, instance, service, interface, or path.

For example, the top-level **SYSTEM SETTINGS** allow you to configure logging of inbound and outbound transactions, policy paths, and message trace. You can select an HTTP interface in the tree on the left to configure the interface settings, traffic monitoring settings, and trace level. You can select the API Gateway instance in the tree to configure its trace level.

You can also select a relative path or service in the tree, and configure the following options:

* **SERVICE SETTINGS**: Select whether the service is enabled.
* **TRANSACTION AUDIT LOGGING LEVEL**: You can select from **Fatal**, **Failure**, and **Success**.
* **TRANSACTION AUDIT PAYLOAD LOGGING**: Disabled by default. See the [**Log Message Payload** filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/monitoring_logging/#log-message-payload-filter).
* **TRANSACTION ACCESS LOGGING**: See [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-access-log-settings).
* **TRAFFIC MONITOR LOGGING**: Select whether traffic monitoring is enabled. For more details, see [Traffic monitoring settings.](/docs/apim_reference/monitor_traffic_events_metrics/#traffic-monitoring-settings)

When finished, click **Apply Changes** at the bottom of the page.
