Windows is supported only for a limited set of developer tools that can be used to manage an an existing deployment running on Linux or in Docker containers. API Gateway and API Manager do not support Windows.

The following tools can be installed on Windows:

* Policy Studio
* Configuration Studio
* Package and deployment tools

You can install the developer tools using the same installer flow as on Linux. To run the installer in the default GUI mode, locate and run the following setup file:

```
APIGateway_7.7_Client_Tools_Install_win-x86-32_BN<n>.exe
```

Because some options do not apply on Windows installation, screens relating to these options are omitted. The components available for Windows can be installed without a license.

You can choose to install the available developers tools either together or separately. Unattended installation is also available.
