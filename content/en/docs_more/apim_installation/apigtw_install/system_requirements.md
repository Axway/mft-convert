## Operating systems and hardware

This section describes the operating system requirements for API Gateway.

### Linux

API Gateway supports the following software versions:

* CentOS 6.x, 7.x, 8.x (CentOS 8.x is supported from [7.7.20200530](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200530_apimgr_relnotes/) update onward.)
* Oracle Linux 6.x, 7.x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x, 7.x, 8.x (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x is supported from [7.7.20200530](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200530_apimgr_relnotes/) update and later updates only.)
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.x, 12.x

API Gateway supports the following hardware:

* 64-bit Linux running on 64-bit hardware
* Intel Core or AMD Opteron at 2Ghz with Dual Core or faster

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}When new Linux kernels and distributions are released, Axway modifies and tests its products for stability and reliability on these platforms.
Axway makes every effort to add support for new kernels and distributions in a timely manner. However, until a kernel or distribution is added to this list, its use with API Gateway is not supported. Axway endeavors to support any generally popular Linux distribution on a release that the vendor still supports.{{< /alert >}}

Your Linux system must have the `LANG` environment variable set. If this variable is not configured correctly, your system might have issues handling Unicode characters in file names. A full installation of Linux should configure this for you automatically. If you are running the API Gateway in a Docker image that you have built, set this variable in your Dockerfile as follows:

```
ENV LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

This variable is automatically set for you in EMT mode.

In CentOS 8.x and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x, the GNU C Library (glibc) no longer includes `libnsl` and `glibc-langpack-en` libraries. However, those were included in previous releases and are required by the API Gateway. To install the missing libraries, run the following command:

```
sudo yum install libnsl glibc-langpack-en
```

### Windows

Windows is supported only for a limited set of developer tools, see [Install developer tools on Windows](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_dev_tools/). API Gateway and API Manager do not support Windows.

This section addresses Policy Studio, Configuration Studio, and Package and Deployment tools only.

Developer tools supports the following software versions:

* Windows 10
* Windows 8.1

Developer tools supports the following hardware:

* 32-bit Windows on both 32-bit hardware and 64-bit hardware
* Intel Core or AMD Opteron at 2Ghz with Dual Core or faster

### Disk space and RAM requirements

The disk space and RAM requirements for Linux platforms are:

* Disk space: minimum 4 GB, 50 GB recommended
* Physical memory (RAM): minimum 8 GB

The disk space and RAM requirements for the developer tools on Windows platforms are:

* Disk space: minimum 2 GB
* Physical memory (RAM): minimum 4 GB

There are also specific requirements for the `/tmp` directory:

* Minimum 500 MB available in the `/tmp` directory and writable permissions on the `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and `/usr/tmp` directories.
* `noexec` must not be set on `/tmp`. If `noexec` is set, you must remount `/tmp` with `noexec` disabled or follow the additional steps detailed in [/tmp directory mounted with noexec](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/#tmp-directory-mounted-with-noexec).

## Databases

This section describes the supported database versions.

### Relational databases

API Gateway and API Manager support the following relational databases to store metrics data:

* MySQL Server 5.7, 8.0
* MariaDB 10.2, 10.5
* Microsoft SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019
* Oracle 12.2, 18c, and 19c
* IBM DB2 10.5

### License keys

API Gateway requires the following license keys.

**Axway license file**:

You must have a valid Axway license file to install the following API Gateway components:

* API Gateway Server
* API Gateway Analytics
* API Manager

You can obtain an evaluation trial license to enable you to evaluate the API Gateway features. However, you must have a full license to enable all API Gateway features for use in a non-evaluation environment (for example, development, testing, or production). To obtain an evaluation trial license or a full license, contact your Axway Account Manager.

You can install an Admin Node Manager in isolation without an API Gateway license. For more information, see [Install the Admin Node Manager](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_node_manager/).

**McAfee license file**:

You must have a valid McAfee license file to use the **McAfee Anti-Virus** filter.

**FIPS-compliant mode license file**:

You must have a valid Axway FIPS-compliant mode license file to run API Gateway in FIPS-compliant mode.

### Multiple installations

API Gateway requires a minimum of two installations for high availability (HA). Make sure that you obtain license keys for all of the API Gateway instances that you are installing.

## Additional prerequisites

This section lists additional prerequisites for installing API Gateway.

On Linux, you must ensure that the installation executable has the appropriate permissions in your environment. For example, you can use the `chmod` command to update the file permissions.

### /tmp directory mounted with noexec

If your Linux system has the `/tmp` directory mounted with `noexec`, you must complete some additional steps before installing or running API Gateway.

**Installation**:

When installing API Gateway, do not install the QuickStart tutorial:

* When running the installer in GUI mode, you must select the **Custom** setup type and deselect the QuickStart tutorial component. For more information, see [Installation options](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/installation/#installation-options).
* When running the installer in unattended mode, you must use the `--setup_type advanced` option and specify `qstart` to the `--disable-components` option. For more information, see [Unattended installation](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/installation_unattended/).

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Do not install the [QuickStart tutorial](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_quickstart_tutorial/) as this option starts Apache Cassandra, the API Gateway server and the Node Manager when installation completes, and in a system with `/tmp` mounted as `noexec` you must make some changes before starting these components.{{< /alert >}}

**Post-installation**:

After completing the installation and before starting the services:

1. Create a new temporary directory that has `exec` privileges (for example, `/opt/Axway-7.7/tmp`).
2. If you installed Cassandra during API Gateway installation, edit the file `CASSANDRA_INSTALL_DIR/conf/cassandra-env.sh` and add the following line:

   ```
   JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Djava.io.tmpdir=<TheNewTmpDir>"
   ```
3. Create or edit the file `VDISTDIR/apigateway/conf/jvm.xml`, and add the following:

   ```xml
   <ConfigurationFragment>
       <VMArg name="-Djava.io.tmpdir=<TheNewTmpDir>
   </ConfigurationFragment>
   ```

### Service packs

Service packs for API Gateway are available from [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/). If any service packs are available for API Gateway 7.7, download and apply them when the installation completes.

For more information on applying a service pack, see [Update API Gateway](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_service_packs).

### Certificates

API Gateway uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for communications between all processes in a domain (for example, internal management traffic between the Admin Node Manager and API Gateway instances).

Certificates are not required during installation; however, certificates will be required after installation to secure API Gateway domains. For more information on configuring and securing API Gateway domains, see the [API Gateway Administrator Guide](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/).
