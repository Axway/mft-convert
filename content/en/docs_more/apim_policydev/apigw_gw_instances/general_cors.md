Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enables client-side code running in a browser in a particular domain to access resources hosted in another domain in a secure manner. Cross-origin requests are typically not permitted by browsers, and CORS provides a framework in which cross-domain requests are treated as same-domain requests.

For example, using CORS, JavaScript embedded in a web page can make an HTTP `XMLHttpRequest` to a different domain. This is used to send an HTTP or HTTPS request to a web server, and to load the server response data back into the script. The following diagram shows an example CORS architecture:

![Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Architecture](/Images/docbook/images/cors/cors_overview.png)

This example is described as follows:

1. A user browses to the following URL:

   ```
   http://client.cors-api.appspot.com
   ```
2. The client page displayed on the left contains JavaScript that attempts to access resources in Domain A (`http://client.cors-api.appspot.com`), and in Domain B (`http://item-a16823:8080`).
3. Attempts by the browser to access resources in Domain A are granted because Domain A is the same domain in which the JavaScript code is running.
4. When the browser attempts to access resources in Domain B, it must use the CORS protocol because Domain B is in a different domain than that in which the JavaScript code is running. In this way, CORS enables client JavaScript code running in the browser in Domain A to access resources in Domain B.

The CORS standard provides CORS HTTP headers that enable servers to serve resources to permitted origin domains. Browsers support these CORS HTTP headers and enforce their restrictions. Browsers can also send *preflight* CORS requests to retrieve supported methods from the server using an HTTP `OPTIONS` method. Then on approval from the server, the browser client can send the request with the appropriate HTTP request method.

The CORS HTTP request headers are as follows:

* `Origin`
* `Access-Control-Request-Method`   (preflight only)
* `Access-Control-Request-Headers`   (preflight only)

The CORS HTTP response headers are as follows:

* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
* `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
* `Access-Control-Max-Age`   (preflight only)
* `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`   (preflight only)
* `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`   (preflight only)

## Add a CORS profile

To enable CORS support in API Gateway, you must first add a CORS profile in Policy Studio:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Environment Configuration** > **Libraries** > **CORS Profiles**.
2. Right-click and select **Add a CORS Profile**, and configure the settings on the following tabs.

### General

Configure the following general settings:

* **Name**:   Unique name of the CORS profile. Defaults to `Cross Origin Resource Sharing`.
* **Enable CORS**:   Specifies whether CORS processing is enabled for the profile. Enabled by default.

### Origins

The **Origins** table enables you to configure the list of origins that are allowed to access resources configured with this CORS profile, or exposed by a specific HTTP service. Click **Add** at the bottom right to add an origin.

You can specify origins using the following values:

* `*`   (permits all values supplied in the CORS `Origin`   header)
* Domain (for example, `http://client.corsapi.appspot.com`)
* Wildcarded value (for example, `http://*.appspot.com`   or `http://client.corsapi.appspot.com:*`)

### Allowed Headers

The **Allowed Headers** table enables you to configure the list of HTTP headers that are permitted when requesting a resource exposed by this CORS profile or HTTP service. The list of headers is defined by the value of the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` CORS header. Click the **Add** button at the bottom right of the window to add an allowed header to the table.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The list of allowed headers is checked only during a CORS preflight `OPTIONS`
request, which can be sent before access to the resource is granted.{{< /alert >}}

### Exposed Headers

The **Exposed Headers** table enables you configure the list of CORS HTTP response headers that are exposed to the client. Click the **Add** button at the bottom right of the window to add an exposed header to the table.

You can specify the list of CORS headers that are exposed to the client, in response to a resource exposed by this profile or HTTP service. You do not need to include the following simple HTTP response headers:

* `Cache-Control`
* `Content-Type`
* `Content-Language`
* `Expires`
* `Last-Modified`
* `Pragma`

### Credentials Support

The **Support credentials** setting specifies whether resources using this CORS profile or HTTP service support user credentials. When this option is selected, the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` CORS header is sent in the response, with a value of `true`. This setting is not selected by default.

### Preflight Results Cache

The **Max. age (seconds)** setting specifies how long the results of a CORS preflight `OPTIONS` request can be stored in the client preflight result cache. When this setting is configured, the `Access-Control-Max-Age` CORS header is sent in the response.

## Configure CORS for HTTP services

You can also configure a CORS profile at the HTTP service level. This means that the settings configured for the profile are also applied to any child resolvers of this HTTP service. For example, this may be useful when using a third-party load balancer, and you need to configure a CORS profile for the default **APIÂ Portal** HTTP service, and specify the load balancer address as an origin.

To configure CORS at the HTTP service level, perform the following steps:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select an HTTP service (for example, **Environment Configuration** > **Listeners** > **API Gateway** > **Default Services**).
2. Right-click, and select **Edit** to display the **HTTP Services** dialog.
3. Select the **CORS** tab, and click the browse button to select a preconfigured CORS profile. By default, no profile is selected, which means that CORS is disabled.
4. In the **Select CORS Profile** dialog, if no profiles have already been configured, right-click **CORS Profiles**, and select **Add a CORS Profile**. You can also right-click an existing profile, and select **Edit** to update its settings. ![Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for HTTP Services](/Images/docbook/images/cors/cors_http_service.png)

## Configure CORS for relative paths

By default, the CORS profile set at the parent HTTP service level is used for all child resolvers of the HTTP service. However, you can override this at the relative path level as follows:

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select a list of relative paths (for example, **Environment Configuration** > **Listeners** > **API Gateway**> **Default Services** > **Paths**).
2. In the **Resolvers** window on the right, right-click a resolver, and select **Edit** to display the dialog.
3. Select the **CORS** tab, and in the **CORS Usage** field, select **Override CORS using the following profile**. By default, no CORS profile is selected, and the parent settings are used.

Relative paths can act as HTTP services, and can accommodate child resolvers. This means that when a relative path has children, and has a CORS profile configured, by default, the children use the parent profile (unless a child overrides it).

1. In the **CORS Profile** field, click the browse button to select a preconfigured CORS profile.
2. If no CORS profiles have already been configured, right-click **CORS Profiles**, and select **Add a CORS Profile**. You can also right-click an existing profile, and select **Edit** to update its settings. ![Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for Relative Paths](/Images/docbook/images/cors/cors_relative_path.png)

Similarly, you can also override CORS for the following relative path resolvers:

* Static Content Providers
* Static File Providers
* Servlet Application
