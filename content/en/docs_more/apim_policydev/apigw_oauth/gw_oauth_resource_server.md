## Resource server policies and filters

API Gateway provides a sample Resource Service policy that is exposed by the OAuth 2.0 Services listener on the path `/api/oauth/protected`. The Resource Service sample policy contains a **Validate Access Token** filter, which is responsible for validating the access token.

![Sample Resource Service policy](/Images/OAuth/sample_resource_service_policy.png)

When an HTTP request for the protected resource comes into the listener, this request contains an Authorization Header containing the access token string. The **Validate Access Token** filter takes the access token string and looks it up in a token store. The token information returned from the store contains the scopes that were issued for this token, its expiry time, the ID of the resource owner, and the Client ID of the application for which it was issued. It also contains any additional information specified at token generation.

The filter checks that the token has not expired and that the token scopes match the scopes required. If the token has expired or the scopes do not match, the filter will fail. Otherwise, it will pass and the request can continue to be processed.

The **Validate Access Token** filter does not take into account the access rights of the resource owner or the HTTP verb used, only that the token has the required access (scopes). These considerations are intentionally left open for policy developers to manage as per their application's requirements. For example, a successfully passing filter will set the `authentication.subject.id` to that of the resource owner who originally authorized the token, and a subsequent filter could decide if the resource owner has individual rights to the resource, or the resource can be modified to represent a user specific resource.

Scopes defined in the filter can use selectors. This can be useful to tie the validation of a token to a request specific attribute, such as the HTTP verb. A filter scope defined as `${http.request.verb}` would ensure that the access token must have a scope called POST when the request is a POST, GET when the request is a GET, and so on. However, this type of configuration must be considered when defining the client application in the Client Application Registry, as to be able to request a token with scopes like POST and GET those scopes must be available to the application. For more information, see [Register and manage OAuth client applications](#register-and-manage-oauth-client-applications).

### Create custom OAuth protected resources

Protected resources are created in Policy Studio by simply adding a **Validate Access Token** filter to a policy that is reachable through a path in a listener. The following steps show an example of creating a suitable policy:

1. Create a policy called `Protected Resource`. In the Policy Studio tree, right click **Policies** and select **Add Policy**.
2. Drag and drop a **Validate Access Token** filter from the OAuth 2.0 filter category onto the policy canvas.
3. To configure the filter select the OAuth access token store against which the token value will be checked, and specify the scopes that must be associated with the token for the filter to pass. The following example specifies `scope.WRITE` and `${http.request.verb}`as the scopes. You can also change the expected location of the token string. This is typically in the Authorization Header, but nonstandard locations are also supported.

![Validate Access Token example](/Images/OAuth/sample_resource_service_filter.png)

After you have created the policy, you can expose it on the existing path, `/api/oauth/protected`, or you can create a new path.

## Register and manage OAuth client applications

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you have installed API Manager, you can register and manage client applications in the API Manager web interface instead of the Client Application Registry.{{< /alert >}}

Client applications that send OAuth requests to the API Gateway’s authorization server must be registered with the authorization server. This section describes how to register and manage client applications (and the scopes they can access) using the Client Application Registry web-based interface.

### Manage client applications in the Client Application Registry

API Gateway provides the Client Application Registry web-based interface for managing client applications. API Gateway also provides the Client Application Registry REST API to enable you to manage client applications on the command line.

You can access the Client Application Registry web interface at the following URL:

```
https://localhost:8089
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must perform the steps described in [Set up API Gateway OAuth server](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_oauth/gw_server/) (for example, enable the OAuth endpoints and import or migrate client applications) before you can manage client applications using the Client Application Registry.{{< /alert >}}

Log in using the Client Application Registry user name and password.

To register a new client application, click the **New application** button.

To edit an existing client application, click the application name in the list of applications. You can add API keys, OAuth credentials, and OAuth scopes for the application. For more information on OAuth scopes, see [Manage OAuth scopes in the Client Application Registry](#manage-oauth-scopes-in-the-client-application-registry).

![Edit application in Client Application Registry](/Images/OAuth/oauth_app_reg_ui_detail.png)

### Scopes in API Gateway

An OAuth scope is a text string used to control access to protected resources. The resource that the scope is associated with determines the meaning of the scope. For example, if a `customer_details` scope is associated with a particular resource, and a client application is associated with the `customer_details` scope, the client application will have access to that resource. Client applications and resources can have multiple OAuth scopes.

For example, in the following overview diagram:

* Client application A can access the `customer_details` scope.
* Client application B can access the `customer_details` and `photos`scopes.
* Client application C can access the `photos`scope only.

![OAuth Scopes](/Images/OAuth/oauth_scopes_overview.png)

In API Gateway, a global OAuth scopes model is used:

* Scopes are defined in policies.
* There can be 1…N listeners routing to 1…N policies. There is no explicit URL to scope mapping defined, instead it is implicitly determined by the listener to policy routing.
* Scopes can be dynamically defined and assigned to registered client applications in the Client Application Registry.
* Supports default scopes, which are scopes assigned if no scopes are requested in the authorization request.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}This scopes model is also supported in API Manager. For more details, see [Scopes in API Manager](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_oauth/apimgr_oauth_resource_server/#scopes-in-api-manager).{{< /alert >}}

### Manage OAuth scopes in the Client Application Registry

You can configure the scopes that a client application can access in the Client Application Registry web interface. When editing the client application, select the **Authentication** tab. In the OAUTH SCOPES section you can specify scopes as free-form text or select a scope from a list of known configured scopes. You can also select a scope as a default scope for the client application. Default scopes are used when an authorization or token request does not contain scopes. The full list of scopes (default and non-default) represents the list of scopes that can be included in an authorization or token request.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}In general, good OAuth design involves a finite number of OAuth scopes. You should decide on the set of scopes to be used in your system instead of creating too many scopes later on.{{< /alert >}}

The following figure shows the default scopes for a client application:

![Configure client application scopes](/Images/OAuth/oauth_scopes.png)

You can specify any text string for an OAuth scope (for example, `customer_details`
or `readonly`).

When an authorization code or access token request is received from a client application, the API Gateway OAuth access token filters check that the scopes in the message match the scopes configured for the client application. If no scopes are provided in the message, the filter creates an access token for the scopes that are configured as default. The scope for which the access token was created is checked against the list of available scopes in the Client Application Registry web interface. This list is generated from the scopes defined in the **Validate Access Token** filter in the server configuration.

You can also specify OAuth scopes using selectors (for example, use `${http.request.verb}`
to map HTTP `GET`and `PUT` requests). However, the Client Application Registry web interface does not display selectorized scopes in the list of available scopes. This is because selectorized scopes in the **Validate Access Token** filter cannot be evaluated at registration time.

The administrator must therefore find out about any selectorized scopes to be applied to resources at runtime. If a scope must be configured using a selector, the administrator must find out exactly which selector to specify in the scope.

### Client Application Registry storage and settings

By default, OAuth client application data is stored in a Key Property Store (KPS) backed by an Apache Cassandra database. For more details on KPS, see the [API Gateway Key Property Store User Guide](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_kps/). For more details on Apache Cassandra, see [Administer Apache Cassandra](/docs/cass_admin/).

#### Relational database-backed Client Application Registry

The Client Application Registry KPS can also be backed by a relational database such as Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2, or Microsoft SQL Server.

#### OAuth relational database schemas

The OAuth relational database schemas can be found in the following directory in your installation:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/system/conf/sql/
```

### Data security

If you have set an encryption passphrase for API Gateway, the OAuth secret and API secret are encrypted in the Client Application Registry.

If you change the encryption passphrase at any point, you must re-encrypt the data in the Client Application Registry or you will not be able to connect to the Client Application Registry web-based interface.

To re-encrypt the data, use the `kpsadmin` tool, and select the option to `Re-encrypt All`. This re-encrypts all data in all tables in a collection. You are prompted for the old passphrase (needed to decrypt the data). The data is then re-encrypted with the current API Gateway passphrase. Repeat this process for each KPS collection.

For more information on the `kpsadmin` tool, see the [API Gateway Key Property Store User Guide](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_kps/).

### Client Application Registry authentication settings

You can configure the Client Application Registry authentication settings in Policy Studio. Click **Environment Configuration > Server Settings** In the Policy Studio tree and select **Security > Client Application Registry**.

You can configure the following fields in the **Authentication Settings** section:

**Circuit for authentication**:
Select a policy to use to authenticate the user. If you have deployed the OAuth server components, a sample policy `Client Registry AuthN-AuthZ` is provided. This policy authenticates the user credentials against the local user store and sets two required attributes on the message whiteboard, which are used to complete authentication and authorization process.

**Subject**:
Enter a selector for the message attribute that contains the user ID (for example, `${authentication.subject.id}`).

**Role**:
Enter a selector for the message attribute that contains the user role (for example, `${authentication.subject.role}`).

**Email**:
Enter a selector for the message attribute that contains the user email (for example, `${user.email}`).

You can configure the following fields in the **Cookie Settings** section:

**Cookie Name**:
Name of the session cookie. Defaults to `CLIENTREGISTRYCOOKIE`.

**Cookie Path**:
Path value for the `Set-Cookie` header. Defaults to `/`.

**Cookie Domain**:
Domain value for the `Set-Cookie` header.

**Cookie Max Age**:
The length of time until the cookie expires. Defaults to 1 day.

**Secure**:
Select the check box to add a `secure` flag to the `Set-Cookie` header.

**HttpOnly**:
Select the check box to add a HttpOnly flag to the `Set-Cookie` header.
