## Create a new project

To create a new project in Policy Studio, select **File** > **New Project** from the main menu, or click **New Project** on the welcome page. Follow the steps in the **New Project** wizard.

For more details, see [Create a project](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_poldev/gs_project/).

## Open an existing project

To open an existing project in Policy Studio, select **File** > **Open Project** from the main menu, or click **Open Project** on the welcome page, and enter the project details in the dialog. Alternatively, click a link to the existing project in the **Recent Projects** pane on the welcome page.

When you select **File** > **Open Project** or click **Open Project** on the welcome page, you can configure the following connection settings in the **Open project** window:

**Location**:
Enter or browse to the full path to the project in the file system (for example, `C:\Users\john\apiprojects\my_test_project`). You can select from the connection history of existing projects in the list.

**Project Name**:
If a valid project location is selected, Policy Studio completes this field with the project name configured in the `.project` file in the specified project **Location**.

**Passphrase**:
Enter the encryption passphrase if one has been configured.

## Save changes to a project

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can select **File** > **Save** from the main menu to save the changes to the current configuration editor.

Alternatively, select **File** > **Save All** to save the changes to all open unsaved configuration editors.

## Deploy changes to a project

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can select **Tasks** > **Deploy** from the main menu to deploy saved changes to a running API Gateway instance at any time. Alternatively, click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar.

For more details, see [Manage API Gateway deployments](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/deploy_get_started/).

## Add an API to a project

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can select **Tasks** > **Add REST API** from the main menu to add an API to the project.

For more details, see [Develop REST APIs in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_web_services/register_rest_apis/).

## Virtualize a web service

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can select **Tasks** > **Virtualize a Service** from the main menu to use the API Gateway to virtualize a web service.

For more details, see [Register and secure web services](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_web_services/).

## Change the project passphrase

You can use the `projchangepass` command to change the encryption passphrase for a Policy Studio project. For more information on `projchangepass`, see [Packaging and deployment tools](/docs/apigtw_devops/deploy_package_tools/).

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}It is important to distinguish between the passphrase used by a project on the local file system and the passphrase used by an API Gateway group configuration on a running API Gateway instance. For details on specifying a different passphrase for runtime, see [Manage API Gateway deployments](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/deploy_get_started/).{{< /alert >}}

For more details on configuring encryption passphrases, see the [API Gateway Administrator Guide](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/).

## Export configuration packages

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you call select **File** > **Export** to save the project as a configuration package. Select one of the following from the menu:

* **Deployment package**:
    Saves the project as a `.fed` file that contains all API Gateway configuration. This includes policies, listeners, external connections, users, certificates, and environment settings.
* **Policy package**:
    Saves the project as a `.pol` file that contains users, certificates, and environment settings.
* **Environment package**:
    Saves the project as a `.env` file that contains policies, listeners, external connections, and environment settings.

When you have saved a configuration package, you can use it to create a Policy Studio project in another environment.

## Import configuration into a project

When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can select **File** > **Import** > **Configuration Fragment** from the main menu to import configuration into the project. This feature enables you to import XML-based configuration previously exported from Policy Studio.

You can also select **File** > **Import** > **Custom filters** to import custom filters to be added to the Policy Studio filter palette.

## Manage multiple projects

You can work with multiple projects in Policy Studio. When a project is loaded in Policy Studio, you can click the Show List icon (**>>**) in the toolbar to display a list of currently open views (for example, other open projects and the welcome page). Select an item in the list to switch between views. The toolbar also displays the number of available views beside the Show List icon in the toolbar.

## Close a project

To close the project currently open in Policy Studio, select **File** > **Close Project** from the main menu. Alternatively, click the **X** icon next to the project name in the toolbar.

## Unlock a server connection

You can also unlock an existing connection to a server. This is for emergency use if you have changed configuration, and this results in you being locked out from the **Management Services** on port `8090`. In this case, you have incorrectly configured the authentication filter in the **Protect Management Interfaces** policy.

For example, if you created and deployed an LDAP connection without specifying the correct associated user accounts, and are now unable to connect to the Admin Node Manager.

To unlock a server connection, perform the following steps:

1. Download all the files in the server's `conf/fed` directory to the machine on which Policy Studio is installed.
2. Start Policy Studio.
3. Create a new project from existing configuration based on the `conf/fed` directory that you downloaded from the server in step 1.
4. Change the configuration details as required (for example, specify the correct user account details for the LDAP connection under the **Environment Configuration** > **External Connections** node).
5. Upload the files back to the server's `conf/fed` directory.
6. Restart the Admin Node Manager.

For more details on **Management Services**, see [Management services](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_gw_instances/general_services/#management-services).
