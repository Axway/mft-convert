Traditionally, the `JVM.xml` file has allowed customers to tweak the behavior of the API Gateway by defining Java system properties.

This page lists all of the Axway-defined Java system properties, per version, from 7.5.3 up to the present, and it explains their purpose and the context in which they are employed.

* The first table, [7.5.3](#753), contains all the properties created in this version.
* All subsequent tables contain newly added properties introduced in that specific version, or service pack, and the assumption is that properties listed in previous tables are inherited.
* Note that because of fix ports, some properties might be duplicated among the three versions: 7.5.3, 7.6.2, and 7.7.

Do not change the system `jvm.xml` file located at `/apigateway/system/conf`. This file is replaced during both updates and upgrades, so any changes made to it will be lost. The `jvm.xml` file defines *include* points that allow you to add custom configuration, which will not be lost when this file is replaced.

You must update the extension `jvm.xml` file, located at `/apigateway/groups/[group X]/[instance Y]/conf`, to apply settings to a single API Gateway instance, and you must update the extension `jvm.xml` file, located at `/apigateway/conf/`, to apply changes to all API Gateway instances on the local machine.

These files do not exist by default, so you must create them first. Both files require that all settings are wrapped in a single `<ConfigurationFragment>` tag, for example:

```
<ConfigurationFragment>
<!-- Your notes, e.g. a link to this page. -->
<VMArg name="-Dsome.property=some.value"/>
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

It is best practice to add XML comments as a reminder for what the setting does, and why the change in behavior is required.

## 7.5.3

All Java system properties that exist in the code up to and including the 7.5.3 release.

| System property                           | Context                                                        | Description  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |---           |
| OAUTH_DIGEST_ALGORITHM                    | API Gateway; OAuth                                             | Specifies the digest algorithm used to store and retrieve tokens from a datastore. When a token is generated it will be hashed with the specified algorithm for storage, when a token is received its value is hashed to retrieve the token properties. The token is also used to store OAuth request state during a three-legged flow. A state ID is generated and the state of a request is stored in a cache against the hash of the state ID. The state can be retrieved in a later request by hashing the state ID and looking it up in the cache. Default value: SHA1. |
| oam.compatibility.mode                    | API Gateway; Oracle Access Manager; Filter Runtime             | Specifies the Oracle Access Manager server version to which the Oracle Access Manager filter connects.

| System Property | Context        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fastCoverage    | Policy Studio; | Specifies whether optimized filter coverage is performed. Loading a complex policy that contains a large number of filters (including a high number of filters with success/failure paths) can take a long time. Setting this property to *true* can speed up the policy loading, but at the cost of a potentially inaccurate list of filter attributes being displayed. Default value: false. |

| System Property                                 | Context                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| com.axway.apimanager.fault.resetHeaders.http429 | API Manager; HTTP                 | Specifies whether response headers are reset/cleared when a HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests; i.e. when a quota has been exceeded) error occurs. Default value: false.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| com.axway.apimanager.fault.removeContentBody    | API Manager; HTTP; Fault Handlers | Specifies whether to remove the reflected request body in an API Manager-generated 400, 404, 405 or 429 HTTP response. By default API Manager reflects the request body in generated responses for 400, 404, 405, and 429 HTTP errors that are not handled by Global Fault handlers. Setting this property to *true* circumvents this issue. Default value: false. |
| distributed.ehcache.cache.reload.pause.secs     | API Gateway; EHCache              | Specifies the duration, in seconds, to pause before recreating caches. Configuration deploy can break distributed ehcache operations. Introducing a delay between re-creating the ehcache manager and the caches themselves resolves the issue. Default value: 5.                                                                                                  |

Default value: true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| OCSP_RSP_VALID_UNTIL                            | API Gateway; OCSP; Filter Runtime | If `OCSP_RSP_VALID_UNTIL_EXPIRATION` property is set to false, this property specifies the expiry time for OCSP response. Default value: 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| OCSP_RSP_VALID_UNTIL_UNITS                      | API Gateway; OCSP; Filter Runtime | If `OCSP_RSP_VALID_UNTIL_EXPIRATION` property is set to false, this property specifies the the units relating to `OCSP_RSP_VALID_UNTIL`; Possible values: 'days', 'hours', 'minutes', 'seconds'. Default value: `days`.                                                                                                                                            |
| OCSP_RSP_VALID_FOR                              | API Gateway; OCSP; Filter Runtime | When an OCSP response with no validation date is encountered, this property specifies how long the OCSP response is valid for. Default value: 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OCSP_RSP_VALID_FOR_UNITS                        | API Gateway; OCSP; Filter Runtime | When an OCSP response with no validation date is encountered, this property specifies the units relating to `OCSP_RSP_VALID_FOR`; Possible values: 'days', 'hours', 'minutes', 'seconds'. Default value: 'hours'.                                                                                                                                                  |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}In the latest version of API Gateway, all `OCSP` settings have been incorporated into the OCSP Client filter, and they no longer have any effect.{{< /alert >}}

| com.apimanager.application.oauth.restrictScopes | API Manager; OAuth; Scopes      | When querying for application scopes, specifies whether to restrict scopes to those explicitly defined for the application (in API Manager, see  *Enable application scopes*), as opposed to including all scopes defined for all APIs that the application has been granted access to. {{% alert title="Note" %}}This property has been removed from the product. An equivalent setting (*Apply application scope restrictions*) has been added to API Manager settings.{{% /alert %}} |
| com.axway.oauth.scopes.check.all.legacy         | API Gateway; API Manager; OAuth | Specifies whether a request is rejected if additional scopes, not configured for OAuth inbound security, are present in the message. When set to true, additional scopes are permitted. Default value: false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| com.axway.apimanager.csrf                       | API Manager; CSRF               | Specifies whether CSRF checks are performed in API Manager. This property allows CSRF to be switched off.

| com.axway.response.redirect.location.relative                       | API Manager; HTTP; Redirects         | Specifies whether the `Location` header, as part of a 3030 response, contains a relative URI. If absolute URIs are required this property can be set to *true*. Default value: true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| com.axway.apimanager.proxy.defaultPath                              | API Manager; Virtualization          | In API Manager, this property specifies the default resource path for a Frontend (virtualized) API. Default value: `/api`      |
| com.axway.apimanager.eventtimestamp.ignorettl                       | API Manager; Cassandra; KPS          | Specifies whether to ignore TTL (time-to-live) for timestamped events (API Manager's PortalTimestamp table). If set to false, events are purged solely by API Manager, rather than Cassandra using TTL to expire data. In a multi-node setup, setting this property can circumvent synchronisation issues between Cassandra nodes, where TTL can prematurely expire data. Default value: false.                                                                                                                                   |

External clients, API keys, and OAuth credentials caches are optimized so that updates to the cache no longer block API Manager runtime traffic, resulting in performance improvements for corresponding API Manager APIs. As a result of the non-blocking cache updates, API Manager memory consumption will increase, particularly in systems with large numbers of external clients, API keys or OAuth credentials. Default value: false. |
| com.axway.apimanager.apiImport.secure.serverCertificateVerification | API Manager; Import                  | Specifies whether hostname verification is performed during the import of an API from an SSL-protected endpoint.This setting was introduced to allow the import of APIs from an endpoint protected by a self-signed certificate.
