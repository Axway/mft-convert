## ext/libs entries

Directory for customer JARs. These can be third-party JARs or JARs with Java code that they have written for their own custom filters. Customers are warned that third-party JARs could conflict with those already installed with the API Gateway in the `system/lib` directory.

There is a system-wide `ext/lib` file, and another one for each API Gateway instance.

```
apigateway/ext/lib
apigateway/groups/group-id/instance-id/ext/lib
```

## ext/posix/bin

This directory contains customers custom scripts.

```
apigateway/ext/posix/bin
```

## ext/Linux.x86_64

```
apigateway/system/conf/jvm.xml
apigateway/conf/jvm.xml
apigateway/groups/group-id/instance-id/conf/jvm.xml
```
