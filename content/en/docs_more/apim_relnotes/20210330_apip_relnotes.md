## New features and enhancements

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working after upgrading from releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

Alternatively you can take the updated `AuthenticateToMaster` policy and apply again your configurations.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
