## Summary

API Portal provides an API consumer-facing interface that you can customize to match your corporate brand. API Portal is a layered product linked to API Manager, and requires both API Manager and API Gateway. For more information, see the API Gateway and API Manager documentation.

## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. For more information, see:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/).
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/).

API Portal in Docker containers is available for production environment from [API Portal 7.7 November 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/) update. For more information, see [Production-ready Docker container](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/#production-ready-docker-container).

*This section was updated to amend the information about API Portal in Docker containers.*

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### API Details page improvements

* You can set a payload limit size to download the response as a file if the response exceeds the size you have set.
* You can configure the colors of the different methods for both SOAP and REST APIs.
* You can set a flag to include or exclude the value for the `externalDocs` attribute. The flag defaults to **On**. When the flag is enabled, the value for the externalDocs attribute is appended to the **Description** field and rendered as part of that field.
* You can configure whether to show **Try it** for groups of HTTP methods per connected API Manager instance. This allows for finer grained control of the **Try it** functionality.

## Known issues

The following are known issues in this version of API Portal.

### Updating API Portal from January 2020 to March 2020 requires the clean up of the temporary folder

Before updating your API Portal 7.7.20200130 (January 2020) to API Portal 7.7.20200330 (March 2020), you must first clean up the `/tmp/axway-apiportal` folder. After that, you can run the update script.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.

### Sign in button is shown after user logs in to API Portal

After user logs in to API Portal, the **Sign in** button is shown in the banner section instead of the **Explore** button.
