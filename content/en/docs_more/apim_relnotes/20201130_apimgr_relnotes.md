## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Run a script to back up and restore Cassandra

An automated script to back up and restore Cassandra clusters is now included in API Gateway. For more information, see [Apache Cassandra backup and restore](/docs/cass_admin/cassandra_bur).

### Enhanced support for OAS3 parameters

Support for the OpenAPI specification 3 (OAS3) parameter attributes is now enriched. The `allowEmptyValue` and `explode` fields, as well as the free-form parameter definition, are all supported in this version of API Manager.

### Enhanced API life cycle management for Organization administrators

We have [previously](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/#organization-administrators-can-publish-apis) released a system property, `api.manager.orgadmin.selfservice.enabled`, to include additional permissions for an Organization administrator to publish and unpublish APIs that were created in their organization without approval from an API Administrator.

In this update, additional API life cycle events (deprecate, undeprecate, upgrade, and grant access to APIs) will also be enabled for an Organization administrator when `api.manager.orgadmin.selfservice.enabled` is set to True.

For more information, see [System property changes](/docs/apim_reference/system_props/).

### YAML configuration store (Technical preview capability)

This update includes bug fixes and enhanced functionality for YAML configuration as follows:

* Support for conversion of [XML configuration fragments to YAML configuration fragments](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_cli/yamles_cli_convert#convert-your-xml-configuration-fragment-to-a-yaml-configuration-fragment).
* Support for [import and export](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_cli/yamles_cli_importexport) of YAML configuration fragments.
* Allow user-controlled file names for YAML entities.
* Improved layout in YAML entity files.
* Enhanced support for managing more configuration content in [externalized files](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_externalized_files).

See the [September 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/#yaml-configuration-store-technical-preview-capability) release notes for an overview of this technical preview, and the [YAML configuration](/docs/apim_yamles/) documentation for more detailed information.

| RDAPI-18674 | 01123229                                         |                | **Issue**: A malicious user can modify data in an unencrypted export file and cause invalid applications to be stored in the database. Invalid applications cannot be deleted or visualized in the API Manager UI. **Resolution**: The Application ID field is now validated. Invalid applications are no longer stored in the database. |
| RDAPI-21336 | 01183015                                         |                | **Issue**: API Manager UI sends a CSRF token as a URL parameter. It should be submitted as a HTTP Header to prevent it from being accessible to collect via upstream proxy/browser logs. **Resolution**: API Manager UI always sends CSRF tokens as HTTP headers.                                                                        |
| RDAPI-22172 | 01205254, 01205882, 01205986, 01208891, 01196812 |                | **Issue**: In API Gateway, when using a Threat Protection profile, requests that are timing out within the gateway lead to a crash of the application due to incorrect memory handling. **Resolution**: Memory is now handled correctly when there is a request timeout with a Threat Protection profile active.                         |

### Other fixed issues

| RDAPI-19278 | 01138179                                         | **Issue**: Migrating an API with its client apps from one org to another, the API access of the migrated app to the new API is removed when the API access is removed from the old org. **Resolution**: API Access is not deleted from the migrated applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| RDAPI-19453 | 01153936  01142389                               | **Issue**: The new Application form in API Manager UI enters an error state when an invalid image file type is uploaded. **Resolution**: The new Application form now recovers from this state after a valid image type is uploaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RDAPI-19958 | 01190536  01206332  01184602  01192821  01155634 | **Issue**: SMTP Servers configured with TLS security in API Manager fail to send emails. **Resolution**: SMTP Servers configured with TLS security now successfully send emails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| RDAPI-19971 | 01146075  01149226                               | **Issue**: Commands "nodemanager" and "startinstance" used with option "-s" to check process status are not showing consistent result when executed by different system user. **Resolution**: Those commands are no longer trying to open the files containing the PID with write access. A correct status is now returned when used by a different user.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RDAPI-20740 | 01168262  01168258                               | **Issue**: In the Policy Studio Settings, the Transaction Access Log 'Format' field could not be environmentalized. **Resolution**: The 'Format' field has been updated so that it can be successfully environmentalized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RDAPI-20817 | 01170172                                         | **Issue**: In API Manager, generated Swagger schema files are not valid Swagger definitions. **Resolution**: Errors have been removed and schema files now respects Swagger specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| RDAPI-20829 | 01168561                                         | **Issue**: In API Manager, all API Access could not be revoked from organizations through the api-promote script. **Resolution**: A new property (organization.apis.remove.all) has been added to the script to allow users to remove all API Access from organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| RDAPI-20919 | 01171136                                         | **Issue**: It is hard to identify from traces the timeout setting involved in connection closure. **Resolution**: Timeout exceptions raised by connections now include the timeout type and the corresponding value that triggered the timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RDAPI-21030 | 01164214                                         | **Issue**: API Manager ignores the "dont.expect.100.continue" Java system property if the Outbound Security is HTTP Basic. **Resolution**: The ConnectToURL filter supports the "dont.expect.100.continue" Java system property when also used with Kerberos or HTTP Basic Authentication profiles. Note that the ConnectToURL filter with Kerberos Authentication profile has been also fixed to respect HTTP protocol of server when sending the Expect 100-Continue header in request.                                                                       |
| RDAPI-21189 | 01153025                                         | **Issue**:  AWS SQS message poller stops working when a disconnection occurs or a message processing results in an error. **Resolution**:  The AWS SQS poller service has been improved to handle connection and processing errors, resulting in polling retries performed as configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RDAPI-21263 | 01180738                                         | **Issue**: API Manager "Import from topology" selects non-SSL ports of a Policy Studio created API. **Resolution**: "Import from topology" now allows the user to select the desired port from a drop-down menu of backend URLs in API Manager UI. It defaults to the SSL port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RDAPI-21436 | 01184617  01185739  01206009  01185976  01184227 | **Issue**: Long startup and deployment time are observed when many APIs are virtualized. **Resolution**: You must add the new "-Dcom.axway.apimanager.configure.apis.nonblocking.enabled=true" property to your JVM configuration file (jvm.xml). The property will start loading APIs after completion of the boot and deployment sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RDAPI-21469 | 01187236                                         | **Issue**: kpsadmin script was returnin inconsistent status codes, for example, 0 (success) instead of 1 (error). **Resolution**: The kpsadmin script exception handling has been updated to address exceptions at the scripts end, allowing for a correct exit code to be determined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| RDAPI-21479 | 01186081                                         | **Issue**: In API Gateway, when an XML body contains special characters, the filter "Check XML Complexity" fails with an error when the XML Prolog is not present, even if an encoding is set in the "Content-Type" header. **Resolution**: The filter "Check XML Complexity" now accepts bodies without XML Prolog by using the encoding passed in the "Content-Type" header, if present (otherwise defaulting to UTF-8)                                                                                                                                       |
| RDAPI-21506 | 01188439                                         | **Issue**: API Manager cannot import Swagger with external docs defined in method. A NullPointerException is thrown. **Resolution**: Error that caused the exception thrown has been fixed. API Manager can now import Swagger files with external docs defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| RDAPI-21557 | 01174059  01173295                               | **Issue**: API Gateway might relay a "100 continue" response from backend when HTTP response has not been fully received (for example, timeout, disconnection). **Resolution**: Connection filter has been corrected to no longer forward the intermediary 100 response received from backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| RDAPI-21679 | 01187897                                         | **Issue**: Amazon SQS Queue Poller dialog does not show the unit type used by the visibility timeout parameter. **Resolution**: The unit type of the visibility timeout (seconds) is now displayed in the configuration dialog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RDAPI-21784 | 01185642  01192682                               | **Issue**: HTTP redaction of a multipart form-data field is not performed when the corresponding Content-Disposition header contains more than one parameter. **Resolution**: HTTP multipart/form-data redaction has been corrected to handle extra header parameters and trigger field redaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| RDAPI-21801 | 01179687  01181723                               | **Issue**: Query parameters are being encoded as they pass from frontend request to backend request. **Resolution**: A java system property com.coreapireg.apimethod.querystring.passthrough has been added that allows API Manager to bypass query string encoding to send the original query parameters to the backend API, while removing any undefined query parameters. To set this property, add the following line to the JVMSettings section of the system/conf/jvm.xml file: `<VMArg name="-Dcom.coreapireg.apimethod.querystring.passthrough=true"/>` |
| RDAPI-21813 | 01196493  01195666                               | **Issue**:  The presence of duplicate certificates (certificates with the same thumbprints) in Policy Studio causes improper handling of certificate entities in memory and may lead to errors in API Gateway. The logged error messages don't specify the root of the problem. **Resolution**: Warning messages are logged in the trace when duplicate certificates are present in Policy Studio. Messages are logged on deploy from Policy Studio and in Certificates screen in Policy Studio when certificates are loaded and manipulated.                   |
| RDAPI-21815 | 01195371                                         | **Issue**: The API Manager API Proxy Registration API method upgrading an existing API to a newer API may timeout with large numbers of API Manager applications and organizations under stress load. **Resolution**: The API Proxy Registration API method upgrading an existing API to a newer API supports large numbers of API Manager applications and organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| RDAPI-21970 | 01200328                                         | **Issue**: In API Manager an exception is thrown when checking a request for optional body parameter when there is no request body. **Resolution**: The check is now only performed if the body parameter is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| RDAPI-21984 | 01200641                                         | **Issue**:  Groovy 2.5 engine throws "No signature of method: java.util.Date.format() is applicable for argument types: (String) values: \[dd-MMM-yyyy]" when formatting dates. **Resolution**: groovy-dateutil jar has been added to API Gateway distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| RDAPI-22061 | 01201966  01198537                               | **Issue**: If a backend API defines a header parameter named 'Content-Type', such parameter is duplicated in the request as there is already an entity header with the same name. **Resolution**: 'Content-Type' header is no longer duplicated in the request. In case of conflict value of entity header takes precedence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

To **update** your API Gateway, see [Update from API Gateway One Version](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion/).

To **upgrade** from an older version, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).

## Update a container deployment

Any custom `fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not.

The `fed` now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.

## Documentation

This section describes documentation enhancements and related documentation.

### Policy Studio help documentation

This update includes changes to the Policy Studio documentation, but the version of the documentation (Eclipse Help) shipped with Policy Studio is out of sync with the online documentation and does not include these changes.

We are working to rectify this issue in a future update. In the meantime, you can find the up to date documentation online at [Develop in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/).

### API Management open source documentation

The latest version of API Gateway, API Manager, and API Portal documentation has been migrated to Markdown format and is available in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/Axway/axway-open-docs) to prepare for future collaboration using an open source model. As part of this migration, the documentation has been restructured to help users navigate the content and find the information they are looking for more easily.

Documentation change history is now stored in GitHub. To see details of changes on any page, click the link in the **Last modified** section at the bottom of the page.
