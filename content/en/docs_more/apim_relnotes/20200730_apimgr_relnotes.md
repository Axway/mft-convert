## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

### ICAP filter improvements

We have made further improvements for Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP) support as embedded AV filters are deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated features](#deprecated-features).

### Improved upgrade instructions

We have improved documentation with more detailed information to upgrade from previous versions to the latest version of the product.

* Added [checklists for upgrading single-node environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/#upgrade-steps---single-node-upgrade-example).
* Created a [list of API Gateway scripts that you must run after upgrade your product](/docs/apim_reference/scripts_changelog_sp/), which provides visibility of the changes from release to release.

### MSSQL Database Support

We have tested and validated `MSSQL 2016/7/9` databases for use with API Gateway and API Analytics.

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

<!-- Use this section to describe any changes in the behavior of the product (as a result of features or fixes), for example, new Java system properties in the jvm.xml file. This section could also be used for any important information that doesn't fit elsewhere. -->

### Filebeat v6.2.2

This update uses Filebeat v6.2.2. Before installing this update, you must delete the Filebeat folder  `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. When using Filebeat, follow the [official Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.6/index.html).

### OpenJDK JRE

API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 and later support OpenJDK JRE, and this update includes Zulu OpenJDK 1.8 JRE instead of Oracle JRE 1.8.

### OpenSSL and FIPS support

This update uses OpenSSL 1.1.1, as OpenSSL 1.0.2 is EOL.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not support FIPS, and running API Gateway in FIPS mode is not supported in this update. OpenSSL 3.0 (when available) will support FIPS, and FIPS support will be available again in a future update.

References to FIPS in the documentation will not be removed, but this does not mean that FIPS is still supported and the references should be ignored.

### Increased validation of WSDLs

The Xerces library has been updated to `xerces 2.12.0`. This library enforces stricter rules when validating malformed schemas. This means that some WSDLs that were previously imported successfully by API Manager might not import successfully in this version.

To suppress schema validation errors and relax the stricter validation of XML files, set the flag `-DwsdlImport.suppressSchemaValidationErrors` to `true` in the `policystudio.ini` file. The default value is `false`.

### API Gateway behavior

#### Anonymous cipher suites

The JRE included in API Gateway disables undesirable cipher suites when using SSL/TLS by default. Users using RSA Access Manager (formerly known as RSA ClearTrust) with API Gateway might experience SSL/TLS handshake issues where no common cipher suites can be found. In this case, you should reconfigure SSL/TLS of the RSA Access Manager to support stronger cipher suites.

Alternatively, to re-enable the anonymous cipher suites in JRE for successful SSL/TLS connections with the RSA Access Manager, remove `anon`  from the  `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` Java security property in the  `INSTALL_DIR/Linux.x86_64/jre/lib/security/java.security` file.

#### Endpoint identification property

The JRE included in API Gateway enables endpoint identification algorithms for LDAPS (secure LDAP over TLS) by default to  improve the robustness of the connections. This might cause API Gateway LDAP filters to fail to connect to an LDAPS server. To disable endpoint identification add the  `<VMArg  name="-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.object.disableEndpointIdentification=true"/>`  line to the  `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file.

#### Connect to URL Filter

If the Connect to URL filter Request Protocol Headers field is not configured correctly, a runtime exception (`unexpected IO error`) is thrown when the filter is executed. In earlier versions, this error did not appear in the logs.

### API Manager behavior

#### Increased validation of `/users` endpoint

In earlier versions of API Manager, the `/users` API returns a list of all the users in an organization. This endpoint allowed a user to share an application with other users in their organization. This was identified as a security risk,  as only organization administrators and API administrators should have access to a list of users, and not user roles. The ability for user roles to view all other user names in the organization has been removed.

To reduce the impact of this change, you can relax this restriction using a configuration flag. Set the flag in the `jvm.xml` file (it does not exist by default) under `groups/group-x/instance-y/conf`.

```xml
<ConfigurationFragment>
    <VMArg name="-DAPIGW_TOGGLE_FEATURE_GET_ALL_USERS=true" />
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

#### Trailing slash property

An inbound API request with a trailing slash can match an API path with no trailing slash. To activate this feature set the Java property `com.vordel.apimanager.uri.path.trailingSlash.preserve` to `true`. The default value is `false`.

#### Content type property

An API method's Content-Type is checked against the API method's defined MIME type when performing path matching. To allow legacy API method matching and disable this check, set the Java property `com.coreapireg.apimethod.contenttype.legacy` to `true`. The default value is `false`.

#### Caching property

Enable caching to improve general system performance and speed. Set the `com.axway.apimanager.api.data.cache` Java system property to `true`. External clients, API keys, and OAuth credentials cache are optimized so that updates to the cache no longer block API Manager runtime traffic, resulting in performance improvements for corresponding API Manager APIs. As a result of the non-blocking cache updates, API Manager memory consumption will increase, particularly in systems with large numbers of external clients, API keys or OAuth credentials.

#### No match property

To configure the status code of an unsuccessful match of an API to 404 when authentication is successful, set the Java property `com.axway.apimanager.use404AuthSuccessNoMatch`  to `true`. The default value is `false`.

#### MIME types

To import API Gateway Management API Swagger into API Manager API Catalog, you must add the `application/x-download` MIME type to the default list of MIME types in API Gateway. Select **Server Settings > General > Mime configuration** in the Policy Studio tree and add `application/x-download` to the MIME list. After the configuration is deployed to API Gateway, you can import the API Gateway Manager API Swagger into API Manager API Catalog.

#### Confidential fields property

Fields that contain confidential information are no longer returned in some API calls. For example, a call to `GET /api/portal/v1.3/proxies/` does not return the password in the `AuthenticationProfile.parameters\["password"]` field. For compatibility with earlier versions, you can continue to return confidential fields. Set the system property `com.axway.apimanager.api.model.disable.confidential.fields` to `false` in the `jvm.xml` file (it does not exist by default) under `groups/group-x/instance-y/conf`.

```xml
<ConfigurationFragment>
    <VMArg name="-Dcom.axway.apimanager.api.model.disable.confidential.fields=false"/>
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Setting this property to `false` is not recommended as it could pose a security risk to your API Gateway installation.{{< /alert >}}

### Security

#### `nosniff` header

The X-Content-Type-Options HTTP header with value `nosniff` is not included in a HTTP response serving static content from the API Gateway or API Manager. This static content is served from the API Gateway or API Manager `webapps` directory. No dynamic content is served from the `webapps` directory. This means that there is no risk of the browser making an incorrect assumption of the content type and exposing a security vulnerability. The X-Content-Type-Options response header with the value `nosniff` is included with HTTP responses serving dynamic content by default.

#### CSRF check property

If you are using the API Manager Management APIs, Client Application Registry APIs, and API Gateway APIs you might need to disable the CSRF token check implemented in v7.5.3 SP9 and later. To disable this check, set the Java system property `com.axway.apimanager.csrf`  to  `false`. The default is `true`.

### Custom filters

If you have written a custom filter using the extension kit, you might need to update your custom code as a result of changes in the classes.

The following interfaces deprecate `_()` and `__()` in favor of a new `resolve()` method:

* `com.vordel.client.manager.ResourceResolver`
* `com.vordel.client.manager.attr.ScreenAttribute`
* `com.vordel.client.manager.wizard.EntityContext`

Both `DefaultGUIFilter` and `VordelWizard` classes do not implement the `ResourceResolver` interface. As a result, any classes extending either of these must replace `_()` and `__()` method calls with `resolve()`.

## Deprecated features

<!-- Add features that are deprecated here -->

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering.

The following capabilities have been deprecated.

### Antivirus scanners

API Gateway already supports the industry standard Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). From the November 2020 update the following embedded antivirus scanners will be removed:

* McAfee
* Sophos
* Clam AV

Content scanning is still supported using the ICAP filter, which provides out-of-the-box integration with ICAP-capable servers provided by Symantec, McAfee, OPSWAT and others, promoting ease of deployment and operational control.

## Removed features

<!-- Add features that are removed here -->

To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities. As part of this review, no capabilities have been removed.

## Fixed issues

This version of API Gateway and API Manager includes:

* Fixes from all 7.5.3, 7.6.2, and 7.7 service packs released prior to this version. For details of all the service pack fixes included, see the corresponding *SP Readme* attached to each service pack on [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com).
* Fixes from all 7.7 updates released prior to this version. For details of all the update fixes included, see the corresponding [release note](/docs/apim_relnotes/) for each 7.7 update.

| RDAPI-17431 | 01090329  01092098                     | **Issue**: API Gateway Policy Studio and `projdeploy` script attempt to redeploy configuration on error response from Admin Node Manager. **Resolution**: Policy Studio and `projdeploy` script attempt to deploy configuration only once as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| RDAPI-18519 | 01108119  01110455                     | **Issue**: The API Manager UI is too slow when using SSO. **Resolution**: The API Manager UI performance is improved by using existing cache of users when querying for a user by DN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| RDAPI-18649 | 01103847  01119176                     | **Issue**: KPS table is not updated with the current user role from the identity provider. **Resolution**: KPS is now updated with the latest user role after the user logs in using SSO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RDAPI-18735 | 01119493  01123904  01122491  01119522 | **Issue**: Previous versions of API Gateway do not allow underscores in host names unless system property `com.axway.apimanager.backend.url.validation.hostname.allowunderscore` is set to `true` in  `jvm.xml`. This contravenes <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4> and <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2> that allow underscores in host names. **Resolution**: Underscore characters are allowed in host names and `com.axway.apimanager.backend.url.validation.hostname.allowunderscore` is no longer evaluated. |
| RDAPI-18776 | 01125844                               | **Issue**: Regex provided as an example in custom property sample in `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/webapps/apiportal/vordel/apiportal/app/app.config` does not work as expected. **Resolution**: Regex is now fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RDAPI-19028 | 01132045                               | **Issue**: API Manager reflected headers if there was a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error, or a request body in generated responses for 400, 404, 405, and 429 HTTP errors, which were not handled by Global Fault handlers. **Resolution**: API Manager now uses the GenericFaultProcessor for these specific errors to stop the headers or request body from being reflected in a response. If the GenericFaultProcessor is not to be used for handling of API Manager specific errors, then set both `com.axway.apimanager.fault.legacy` and `com.axway.apimanager.fault.removeContentBody` Java system properties to true to stop API Manager reflecting the request body in the response. Also set `com.axway.apimanager.fault.resetHeaders.http429` Java system property to true to remove the headers from the response when there is HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error.
| RDAPI-19055 | 01169350  01134247  01129352  01134331                                                             | **Issue**: API Manager API Service Context is missing in open traffic and event logs in some scenarios. **Resolution**: The API Manager Service Context is now available for failed API method requests. The failed API method requests are shown as blocked in the API Manager monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It had no effect on the routing of requests through a proxy server. **Resolution**: Enabled the use of the `http.nonProxyHosts` property in API Manager and it can now be used to define the hosts that should not be routed through a proxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Policy Studio help documentation

This update includes changes to the Policy Studio documentation, but the version of the documentation (Eclipse Help) shipped with Policy Studio is out of sync with the online documentation and does not include these changes.

We are working to rectify this issue in a future update. In the meantime, you can find the up to date documentation online at [Develop in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/).

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

These instructions apply to API Gateway and API Manager classic deployments only. For container deployments, see [Update a container deployment](#update-a-container-deployment).

### Prerequisites

This update has the following prerequisites in addition to the [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

1. Shut down any Node Manager or API Gateway instances on your existing installation.
2. Back up your existing installation. You can use the `update_apigw.sh` script to take a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory as detailed in the [API Gateway server install steps](#install-the-api-gateway-server-update), or you can manage your own backups as detailed in [API Gateway backup and disaster recovery](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/manage_operations/#api-gateway-backup-and-disaster-recovery). Ensure that you back up any customized files. You should merge updated files instead of copying them back directly to avoid any regex matching issues, whether you manage your own backups or not. For example, the following directories might contain customized files:

   ```
   webapps/apiportal/vordel/apiportal
   webapps/emc/vordel/manager/app
   webapps/emc
   system/conf/apiportal/email
   system/conf
   samples/scripts/
   tools/filebeat-VERSION-PLATFORM
   ```
3. If you have an existing Apache Cassandra installation, ensure that you back up your data (Cassandra and `kpsadmin`), and that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly in `cassandra.in.sh` and `cassandra.in.bat`.
4. Remove the old Filebeat folder `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. Check any customized files to see if they are compatible with the new version. See [Filebeat](#filebeat-v6-2-2) for more information.
5. On Linux, remove existing capabilities on product binaries (which might prevent overwriting files):

   ```
   setcap -r INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/bin/vshell
   ```

### FIPS mode only

If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Run `togglefips --disable` to turn FIPS mode off.
2. Start the Node Manager to move the JARs.
3. Stop the Node Manager.
4. Install the API Gateway update as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
5. Start the Node Manager.

In Policy Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Policy Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Policy Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Policy Studio using the `policystudio -clean` command.

In Configuration Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Configuration Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Configuration Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Configuration Studio using the `configurationstudio -clean` command.

### Installation

This section describes how to install the update on existing 7.7 installations of API Gateway or API Manager.

* If you have installed an existing version of API Manager, installing the API Gateway server update automatically also installs the updates and fixes for API Manager.
* If you have installed a licensed version of API Gateway or API Manager 7.7, you do not require a new license to install updates.

#### Install the API Gateway server update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway 7.7 server installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove any previous patches from your `INSTALL_DIR/ext/lib` and `INSTALL_DIR/META-INF` directories (or the `ext/lib` directory in an API Gateway instance). These patches have already been included in this update. You do not need to copy patches from a previous version.
3. Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 server Update file into a new directory. For example:

   ```
   mkdir 77update
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Core_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
   ```

    {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.{{< /alert >}}
4. Run the [`update_apigw.sh` script](#update-apigw-sh-script) from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify  your API Gateway installation directory using the `--install_dir` option. For example:

   ```
   ./update_apigw.sh --install_dir /opt/Axway-7.7/
   ```
5. Restart your Node Manager and API Gateway instances on the local machine.

##### `update_apigw.sh` script

Run the `update_apigw.sh` script with the `--help` option to see the available options:

```
./update_apigw.sh --help
```

The script generates a trace file in the `update-output/trace` directory. Use the `--tracelevel` option to change the level of tracing.

The script takes a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory and places it in a `tar` file in the `update-output/backups` directory. Specify a different directory using the `--backup_dir` option. To manage your own backups, use the `--no_backup` option.

To run the script without user interaction, specify `--mode unattended` option.

Running the `update_apigw.sh` script performs the following steps:

1. Check that the installation directory is valid.
2. Check that the user who owns the API Gateway binaries is the same user running the `update_apigw.sh` script.
3. Check that the Node Manager and API Gateway instances that run on the local machine are not running.
4. Take a backup unless `--no_backup` has been specified.
5. Install the update content into the API Gateway installation directory.
6. Perform all of the steps that were performed by a post installation script in earlier updates. This includes JRE cleanup, `system/lib/modules` cleanup, third-party and Axway JAR cleanup, apply `acl.json` fix, apply passphrase obfuscation fix, and apply modifications to Node Manager entity store configuration. Fixes are only applied if they have not previously been applied.

#### Install the Policy Studio update

To install the update on your existing Policy Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio`.

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Policy Studio update.
{{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_policy_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `policystudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `policystudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Policy Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_policy_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update over the `policystudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Policy Studio with `policystudio -clean`.

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/policystudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the Configuration Studio update

To install the update on your existing Configuration Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio`.

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Configuration Studio update.
{{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_configuration_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `configurationstudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `configurationstudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Configuration Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_configuration_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update over the `configurationstudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Configuration Studio with `configurationstudio -clean`

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/configurationstudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the API Gateway Analytics update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway Analytics 7.7 installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway Analytics instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove old third-party libraries by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/system/lib/modules
   ```
3. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/platform/jre
   ```
4. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/analytics/posix/bin
   ```
5. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway Analytics binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Analytics Update over the `analytics` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory. For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Analytics_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/analytics/
   ```
6. Change to the `analytics` directory in your installation:

   ```
   cd INSTALL_DIR/analytics
   ```
7. Run the post-install script for API Gateway Analytics.

   ```
   apigw_analytics_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

You must also install an update for your existing API Gateway 7.7 server.

### After installation

The following steps apply after installing the update.

#### API Gateway

To allow an unprivileged user to run the API Gateway on a Linux system, perform the following steps:

1. Add the following line to the `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file:

   ```
   <VMArg name="-Djava.library.path=$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64/server:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib/engines:$VDISTDIR/ext/$DISTRIBUTION/lib:$VDISTDIR/ext/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib:system/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib"/>
   ```
2. Run the command `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep cap_sys_rawio=+ep' INSTALL_DIR/platform/bin/vshell` to allow the API Gateway to listen on privileged ports.

#### API Manager

When API Manager is installed, you must run the `update-apimanager` script after the API Gateway post-install script to ensure that all paths are up-to-date. For details, see [Run update-apimanager](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/#run-update-apimanager).

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}} Before executing the `update-apimanager` script:

* Apply the update to all API Gateways.
* Ensure that all Node Managers and API Gateway instances are running.

{{< /alert >}}

## Update a container deployment

If a `fed` file is provided as part of building the API Manager container, you must follow these steps to update the `fed` with the configuration changes:

1. Install the update on a installation of the API Gateway.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   /opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --fed <path to old file>.fed --oa <path to update file>.fed
   ```

You do not need to run any API Manager instances.

The `fed` now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.
