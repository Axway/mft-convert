## Summary

API Portal provides an API consumer-facing interface that you can customize to match your corporate brand. API Portal is a layered product linked to API Manager, and requires both API Manager and API Gateway. For more information, see the API Gateway and API Manager documentation.

## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in a Docker container. For more information, see the following options:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/).
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/).
* You can use the [cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script) to upgrade directly from earlier versions (for example, 7.5.5, 7.6.2) to API Portal 7.7 November.
* See [API Portal single version upgrade](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-from-api-portal-7-6-2) to upgrade versions incrementally.
* To deploy API Portal in Docker containers, see [Deploy API Portal in containers](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_docker/).

## New features and enhancements

### Production-ready Docker container

In this update, we are releasing the phase 1 of API Portal production-ready Docker container image, which involves the following:

* Internal security review completed.
* Support for CentOS 8.
* Build and run docker as non-root user.
* The container is upgradable.

### Red Hat Enterprise 8 support

* Official support added for RHEL 8 for the standalone (non-docker) API Portal.
* Supported [platform matrix](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Axway_Products_SupportedPlatforms_allOS_en/resource/Axway_Products_SupportedPlatforms_allOS_en.pdf) updated to include RHEL 8.

### Security improvements

* [Virus scanning of uploaded files](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/secure_harden_portal/#enable-scanning-of-uploaded-files) via API Portal interface.
* Personally identifiable information (PII) is now protected using Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) in [all log files](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/apip_logging/) generated by API Portal. Each user in API Portal is associated to a GUID, which is used instead of the user name to protect the user data in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Cumulative upgrade script

We had previously released a [cumulative upgrade](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/#easy-upgrade-from-755-and-762) script to help customers to upgrade from 7.5.5 and 7.6.2 to the [7.7 July 2020​](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/) update. This script has been updated to upgrade customers to the 7.7 November 2020 update in line with the end of support for the 7.5.x and 7.6.x product lines​ in November 2020.

For more information, see [Upgrade API Portal using the cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script).

### User experience improvements

* Upgrade to API Portal 7.7.20201130 is supported from [API Portal 7.7](/docs/apim_relnotes/201904_release/apip_relnotes/) only.
* This update is not available as a virtual appliance or as a managed service on Axway Cloud.
* Upgrading from previous API Portal Docker image is not supported.

## Important changes

There are no major changes in this update.

## Deprecated features

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering. In this update, the following capabilities have been deprecated:

* API Portal versions 7.5.x and 7.6.x reached end of support (EOS) in November 2020.

## Removed features

### Enable user listing configuration

After a recent security fix in API Manager, the **Enable user listing** option is no longer needed in API Portal, and has been removed.

For previous versions of API Portal, which still use the **Enable user listing** option, see [API Portal - Customize application sharing settings](https://support.axway.com/en/admin/kbadmin/article-details/id/181283).

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working in releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
