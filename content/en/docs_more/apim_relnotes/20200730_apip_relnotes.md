## Summary

API Portal provides an API consumer-facing interface that you can customize to match your corporate brand. API Portal is a layered product linked to API Manager, and requires both API Manager and API Gateway. For more information, see the API Gateway and API Manager documentation.

## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. For more information, see:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/).
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/).
* You can use the [cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script) to upgrade directly from earlier versions (for example, 7.5.5, 7.6.2) to API Portal 7.7 July.
* See [API Portal single version upgrade](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-from-api-portal-7-6-2) to upgrade versions incrementally.

API Portal in Docker containers is available for production environment from [API Portal 7.7 November 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/) update. For more information, see [Production-ready Docker container](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/#production-ready-docker-container).

*This section was updated to amend the information about API Portal in Docker containers.*

## New features and enhancements

### Non-root installer​

To expand compliance with many customers internal security guidelines, which discourage or disallow root access, we have added the ability to install and run API Portal using `sudo` commands.​ To learn more, watch [How to install API Portal without being a root user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5RZjP9Zl7k&list=PLSlCpG9zsECpo8-JMZ2Cx4REDyUvpwy9v)​.

### CentOS 8​ support

We have expanded official support to include CentOS 8 for the standalone (non-docker) installation of API Portal.

Supporting CentOS8 in a docker container is not yet supported.​

### UI/UX improvements

User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) improvements in this release:

* Better filtering options available to **User** roles on the applications catalog to allow easier searching and management of large catalogs​.
* New API state indicators for *Published* and *Unpublished* to make the current status of the endpoint clearer.
* Improved visibility of *Deprecated* APIs​.

### Cumulative upgrade script

This update is shipped with a [cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script) to help customers to upgrade from 7.5.5 and 7.6.2 to the 7.7 July 2020​ update.

| IAP-1934    |         |                | **Issue**: Servers should be synchronize to an internal or external NTP server in order to correlate logs and data from different internal and external systems. **Resolution**: Documentation was updated with this best practice.

| IAP-1929    |         |                | **Issue**: User sessions were not revoked on application level even when the user was active. **Resolution**: Added a configuration option in JAI to invalidate all user sessions with the application after defined time period.                                                                                                                                             |

| IAP-1732    |         |                | **Issue**: API Portal HTTPS request to API Manager REST API wasn't protected with certificate verification option. **Resolution**: As per Security practice we have introduced mutual authentication between API Portal and API Manager.                                                                                                                                      |
| IAP-3324    |         |                | **Issue**: `Swagger-ui` is using vulnerable third-party dependency - `remarkable@1.7.4`. **Resolution**: API Portal is now using `Swagger-ui` with upgraded version of this package which is no longer vulnerable - `remarkable@2.0.1` and respectively `swagger-ui@3.26.0`.                                                                                                  |
| IAP-3282    | 1157947 |                | **Issue**: There is no recommendation in the documentation that `Referrer-Policy` header should be set with proper policy. **Resolution**: Documentation was updated. See [Configure Apache section](https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/secure_harden_portal/#configure-apache) for recommendation on how to set this policy.       |
| IAP-3283    | 1157947 |                | **Issue**: There is no recommendation in the documentation how to set `SameSite` cookie attribute. **Resolution**: Documentation was updated.

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working. To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

Related Issue:IAP-3435

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
