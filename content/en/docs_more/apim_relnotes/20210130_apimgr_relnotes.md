## Installation

* To **update** your API Gateway, see [Update from API Gateway One Version](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion/).
* To **upgrade** from an older version, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).
* For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).
* For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

### Update a container deployment

Any custom `fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not.

The `.fed` files contain the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Option to disable SSL renegotiation is added for HTTPS listeners and Connection filters

We have added a new option, **Disable renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier**, in Policy Studio to allow you to disable SSL renegotiation when configuring HTTPS interfaces or connecting to URL filters. This option is enabled by default, meaning that renegotiation is not allowed, and listeners do not send HelloRequest messages, and they ignore renegotiation requests via ClientHello.

For more information, see:

* [Configure Advanced SSL settings](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_gw_instances/general_services/#configure-advanced-ssl-settings)
* [Connect to URL filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/routing_common/)

### Backup passphrase parameter to restore operation in kpsadmin

We have added a new `--passphrase` parameter to the restore operation in `kpsadmin`.
If the parameter is not specified the script will prompt for a passphrase. The passphrase parameter is provided to allow data that may be encrypted at rest, be decrypted when being restored into the target API Gateway environment. For more info, see [Manage KPS using kpsadmin](https://developjan21--axway-open-docs.netlify.app/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_kps/how_to_use_kpsadmin_command/).

### Content Security Policy header to improve security

The Content Security Policy (CSP) header sets a policy that instructs the browser to only fetch resources, such as scripts, images, or objects, from the specified locations. A compliant browser will deny loading any resources from locations not listed in the policy. The CSP header reduces an attacker's ability to inject malicious content and helps to protect a web page from attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), dynamic code execution, and clickjacking.

For more information, see [Define a restrictive content security policy](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/secure_harden_portal/#define-a-restrictive-content-security-policy).

### YAML configuration store (Technical preview capability)

This update includes bug fixes and enhanced functionality for YAML configuration as follows:

* Support for [certificates and keys](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_edit/#add-a-new-certificate-and-private-key-to-a-yaml-configuration) in standard PEM files.
* Enhanced support for managing more configuration content in [externalized files](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_externalized_files).
* Restructured [entity type](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_references/yamles_types/) information into separate files to enable custom type support.
* Enhanced policy readability.
* Enhanced support for environmentalization with encryption.
* Fix issue of reordering fields in YAML files after configuration edits via tooling.
* Support for `${env.CERT}` environmentalization of certificates in the YAML configuration.

See the [September 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/#yaml-configuration-store-technical-preview-capability) release notes for an overview of this technical preview, and the [YAML configuration](/docs/apim_yamles/) documentation for more detailed information.

## Important changes

<!-- It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.. -->

There are no major changes in this update.

## Deprecated features

<!-- As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering. In this update, the following capabilities have been deprecated. -->

In the [January 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200130_apimgr_relnotes/) update, we have announced the deprecation of all the Antivirus filters in API Gateway. This is a reminder that in July 2021 we will remove the Antivirus filters from API Gateway. So, we recommend you to use the API Gateway's ICAP capability, which allows the gateway to integrate with ICAP capable external virus scanners.

## Removed features

No capabilities have been removed in this update.

<!-- To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities. As part of this review, the following features have been removed: -->

It interprets the data written in Key Property Store (KPS) as code and thus executes what is stored inside a KPS entry. **Resolution**: Security vulnerability has been fixed.                   |

### Scripting filter whiteboard attributes not preloaded for Jython scripts

The Scripting filter now uses a Jython 2.7 scripting environment (previously, Jython 2.5) to execute Jython scripts. As a result of this version change, the whiteboard attributes, such as `http.request.uri` and `http.request.verb`, are no longer preloaded for use by Jython scripts. However, you can run a Jython script to load these attributes before they are accessed as follows:

```
from com.vordel.trace import Trace

def invoke(msg):
    msg.forceGenerateAttributes()
    Trace.info("This trace statement was generated in script filter!  [" + str(msg.get("http.request.verb")) + "] [" + str(msg.get("http.request.uri")) + "]")
    return True
```

### When an API Gateway instance is started, Xerces SAXParserImpl writes warnings to the error console

At API Gateway instance startup, the following warnings are logged to the error console, as opposed to the trace log:

```
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD' is not recognized.
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/entityExpansionLimit' is not recognized.
```

These new properties were added in JAXP 1.5 specification, which is supported by the embedded implementation in the JRE but not supported yet in Xerces-J Apache implementation. These are harmless warning messages, which are written to the error console instead of throwing an exception if a property is not supported by the Apache Xerces-J implementation.
