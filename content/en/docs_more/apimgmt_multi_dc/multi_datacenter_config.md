}

This section explains the following for each data type:

* If the data can be replicated across both datacenters (for example, by deploying in both datacenters or automatic replication)
* How to configure the replication (for example, by configuring Apache Cassandra, Ehcache, or RDBMS)
* How to install and configure API Gateway and API Manager in multiple datacenters, and how to optimize performance

For details on recommended architecture, see [Multi-datacenter deployment](/docs/apimgmt_multi_dc/#multi-datacenter-deployment).

## API Management configuration

The recommended configuration for each data type and its replication between datacenters is as follows:

### API Gateway data

* **API Gateway configuration**: You must deploy the API Gateway group configuration in both datacenters.
* **API Gateway logs**: Does not apply (local file-based data only).
* **API Gateway traffic monitoring**: Does not apply (local file-based data only).
* **API Gateway KPS custom tables**: Automatic. It is recommended to use Cassandra with replication between datacenters. See [Configure Cassandra for multiple datacenters](#cassandra_multiple), or your RDBMS documentation.
* **API Gateway OAuth token store**: It is recommended to use Ehcache, and to generate and use OAuth tokens in the same datacenter only. You should configure sticky sessions in your load balancer. See [Configure Ehcache in multiple datacenters](#configure-ehcache-in-multiple-datacenters).
* **API Gateway throttling counters**: It is recommended to configure at least one distributed cache per datacenter and to avoid replication between datacenters. You should configure sticky sessions in your load balancer. See [Configure Ehcache in multiple datacenters](#configure-ehcache-in-multiple-datacenters).
* **API Gateway custom cache**: It is recommended to configure at least one distributed cache per datacenter and to avoid replication between datacenters. You should configure sticky sessions in your load balancer. See [Configure Ehcache in multiple datacenters](#configure-ehcache-in-multiple-datacenters).

### API Manager data

* **API Manager catalog, client registry, web-based settings**: Automatic. It is best to use Cassandra with replication between datacenters. See [Configure Cassandra for multiple datacenters](#cassandra_multiple).
* **API Manager quota counters**: In memory only, or automatic when using external storage (Cassandra or RDBMS). See [Configure API Manager quota in multiple datacenters](#api-manager-quota). See also [Configure Cassandra for multiple datacenters](#cassandra_multiple), or your RDBMS documentation.
* **API Manager metrics**: Automatic. See your RDBMS documentation.

### API Gateway Analytics data

* **API Gateway Analytics configuration**: You must deploy the group configuration on both datacenters. For details on automating deployment processes, see the API Gateway DevOps Deployment Guide.
* **API Gateway Analytics metrics**: See your RDBMS documentation.

## Configure Cassandra for multiple datacenters {#cassandra_multiple}

Cassandra is required to store data for API Manager data, and also recommended for API Gateway custom KPS tables. For details on the recommended Cassandra architecture, see [Multi-datacenter deployment architecture](/docs/apimgmt_multi_dc/#multi-datacenter-deployment-architecture).

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must install and configure Cassandra on each node in both datacenters before installing and configuring API Gateway and API Manager.{{< /alert >}}

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to Cassandra in a multi-datacenter production environment:

* Ensure that Cassandra version 2.2.12 is installed. For details, see [Install an Apache Cassandra database](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/cassandra_install/).
* You must have at least three Cassandra nodes per datacenter. Cassandra must be installed on each node in the cluster, but should not be started until the Cassandra cluster is fully configured. For more details, see [Install an Apache Cassandra database](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/cassandra_install/).
* Configure `JAVA_HOME` to a JRE 1.8 installation.
* Each Cassandra node must have Python 2.7.x installed.
* Time must be synchronized on all servers.
* Determine a naming convention for each datacenter and rack, for example:
    * `DC1`, `DC2`
    * `RACK1`, `RACK2`, `RACK3`
    {{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}The rack names must be exactly the same in each datacenter. You should choose the names carefully because renaming a datacenter is not possible.{{< /alert >}}
* Determine the seed nodes. You must have at least two Cassandra seed nodes per datacenter.
* Choose a unique name for the Cassandra cluster.
* To avoid firewall issues, you must open the following ports to allow bi-directional communication among the nodes:
    * `7001`: Cassandra TLS/SSL inter-node cluster communication
    * `7199`: Cassandra JMX monitoring port (only enabled on `localhost` for security reasons, you must use SSH to connect the machine).
    * `9042`: CQL native client port (only required for an API Gateway or API Manager client connection to Cassandra)

### Configure your cassandra.yaml file

On each node in the cluster, you must configure the following properties in the `CASSANDRA_HOME/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml` file:

#### Configure multi-datacenter settings

Configure the following settings in `cassandra.yaml`:

* `cluster_name`: Your chosen cluster name, common across both datacenters (for example, `cassandra-cluster1`)
* `num_tokens`: `256`
* `endpoint_snitch`: `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch`
* `-seeds`: Internal IP address for all seed nodes. Each datacenter should have its own seed node IP addresses first, followed by the other datacenters seed nodes. This is critical for replication.
    For example:
    * DC1 seed nodes: `192.168.10.1`, `192.168.10.2`
    * DC2 seed nodes: `192.168.20.1`, `192.168.20.2`
    * DC1 configuration:
        * `-seeds`: `192.168.10.1`, `192.168.10.2`, `192.168.20.1`, `192.168.20.2`
    * DC2 configuration:
        * `-seeds`: `192.168.20.1`, `192.168.20.2`, `192.168.10.1`, `192.168.10.2`
* `listen_address`: Specify the *private* IP address of the current node that you are configuring.
* `broadcast_address`: Specify the *public* IPÂ address of the node. For example, this is important when using a VPN with Network Address Translation (NAT) of IP addresses. Communication between datacenters can only take place using an external IP address.
* `start_native_transport`: `true`
* `native_transport_port`: `9042`

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must remove `cassandra-topology.properties` from `cassandra/conf/`. This is not needed when `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch` is set and could cause conflicts.{{< /alert >}}

#### Configure authentication settings

It is recommended to enable authentication. Set the following properties:

* `authenticator`: `org.apache.cassandra.auth.PasswordAuthenticator`
* `authorizer`: `org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer`

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}When these properties are set, you must change the default Cassandra user.{{< /alert >}}

#### Configure TLS/SSL traffic encryption

It is recommended to enable inter-node and client-to-node TLS/SSL encryption. API Management supports TLS v1.2.

**Node-to-node encryption:**

To enable node-to-node TLS/SSL traffic encryption, set the following properties:

`server_encryption_options`:

* `internode_encryption`: `all`
* `keystore`: `my-server-keystore.jks`
* `keystore_password`: `MY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
* `truststore`: `my-server-truststore.jks`
* `truststore_password`: `MY_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD`
* `require_client_auth`: `true`

**Client-to-node encryption:**

To enable client-to-node SSL traffic encryption, set the following properties:

`client_encryption_options`:

* `enabled`: `true`
* `optional`: `false`
* `keystore`: `my-client-keystore.jks`
* `keystore_password`: `MY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
* `truststore`: `my-client-truststore.jks`
* `truststore_password`: `MY_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD`
* `require_client_auth`: `true`

### Configure your cassandra-rackdc.properties file

Configure the `cassandra/conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties` file with your chosen datacenter and rack names for each node, and set `prefer_local=true`.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}The rack names must be exactly the same in each datacenter. You should choose the names carefully because renaming a datacenter is not possible.{{< /alert >}}

For example:

| Node       | Setting in cassandra-rackdc.properties |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| DC1, node1 | `dc=DC1 rack=RACK1 prefer_local=true`  |
| DC1, node2 | `dc=DC1 rack=RACK2 prefer_local=true`  |
| DC1, node3 | `dc=DC1 rack=RACK3 prefer_local=true`  |
| DC2, node1 | `dc=DC2 rack=RACK1 prefer_local=true`  |
| DC2, node2 | `dc=DC2 rack=RACK2 prefer_local=true`  |
| DC2, node3 | `dc=DC2 rack=RACK3 prefer_local=true`  |

### Start your Cassandra nodes

When you have configured `cassandra.yaml` and `cassandra-rackdc.properties` on all nodes, you can start the seed nodes one at a time, followed by the remaining nodes in each datacenter.

### Configure cqlsh for TSL/SSL encryption

If the Cassandra cluster has been configured to use client-to-node TSL/SSL encryption, you must configure all clients connecting to the cluster (including `cqlsh`) to use TSL/SSL. `cqlsh` is a Python-based command line client for executing Cassandra Query Language (CQL) commands.

To configure `cqlsh` for TSL/SSL, you must provide the following certificates in a `cqlshrc` file:

* `certfile.pem`: Contains the CA or server certificate of the Cassandra node. This is specified in `my-client-keystore.jks`.
* `usercert.pem`: Contains the client certificate for `cqlsh`. This needs to be added to the Cassandra truststore: `my-client-truststore.jks`
* `userkey.pem`: Contains the private key of client certificate for `cqlsh`. This cannot contain a passphrase.

A sample is provided in `cassandra/conf/cqlshrc.sample`:

When TSL/SSL has been configured, run the following command:

```
./cqlsh -u cassandra -p MY_PASSWORD --ssl --cqlshrc=MY_CQLSHRC_FILE 192.168.10.1
```

### Configure the default system_auth keyspace

When all nodes are online, if authentication is enabled, you must set the replication strategy and replication factor for the `system_auth` keyspace to ensure that credentials are shared across the cluster. You can do this using the `cqlsh` tool from the `cassandra/bin` directory.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must set the replication strategy to `NetworkTopologyStrategy`, and ensure the replication factor is set to the number of nodes per datacenter (for example, `3`).{{< /alert >}}

Naming is case sensitive and the keyspace definition must use the snitch-configured datacenter names used in `cassandra-rackdc.properties`.

For example, on Cassandra node 1 in DC1, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `cassandra/bin` directory
2. Log in to `cqlsh` using the IP address of the current node. For example:

    ```
    ./cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra 192.168.10.1
    ```

3. Run the following command:

    ```
    ALTER KEYSPACE "system_auth" WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC1' : n, 'DC2' : n};
    ```

    In this example, `n` is the number of nodes per datacenter.

4. Run `nodetool repair` on each node as follows:

    ```
    ./nodetool repair system_auth
    ```

5. Change the default Cassandra user. For more details, see the [Configuring authentication](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/configuration/secureConfigNativeAuth.html?hl=authentication) documentation.

## Configure API Management in multiple datacenters

When the Cassandra cluster has been set up, you can proceed with installing API Gateway and API Manager. You must have at least two API Gateway instances per datacenter.

### Configure the first API Gateway node

On the first API Gateway host in DC1, perform the following steps:

1. Install API Gateway and API Manager using the API Gateway installer. Do not select Cassandra, which has already been installed. For more details, see [Install API Manager](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_api_mgmt).
2. Register the Admin Node Manager using the `managedomain` command in `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/posix/bin`.
3. Start the Admin Node Manager using the `nodemanager` command.
4. Add the API Gateway instance and group using the `managedomain` command.
5. Before starting the API Gateway instance, add the Cassandra host names and IP addresses as environment variables in your `envSettings.props` file located in `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf`. For example:

    ```
    env.CASS.NAME1=Host 10.1
    env.CASS.NAME2=Host 10.2
    env.CASS.NAME3=Host 10.3
    env.CASS.HOST1=192.168.10.1
    env.CASS.HOST2=192.168.10.2
    env.CASS.HOST3=192.168.10.3
    env.CASS.REPL.FACTOR=DC1:3;DC2:3;
    ```

6. Start the API Gateway using the `startinstance` command in `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/posix/bin`.
7. Configure the API Gateway to connect to the Cassandra cluster. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings > Cassandra**, and configure the following:
    * **Keyspace**: Name of the API Gateway Cassandra keyspace to be created when deployed. Defaults to `x${DOMAINID}_${GROUPID}`
    * **Initial replication strategy**: Network Topology Strategy
    * **Initial replication**: `${env.CASS.REPL.FACTOR}`
    * **Hosts**: Add the environment variable settings that you set in `envSettings.props`. For example:
        ![Set Cassandra hosts using environment variables](/Images/APIGateway/cassandra_multi-dc_hosts.png)
    * **Authentication**: Enter the Cassandra user name and password that you configured earlier. See [Configure the default system_auth keyspace](#configure-the-default-system-auth-keyspace).
    * **Security**: Select **Enable SSL**, and select a trusted certificate and client certificate. For example:
8. Select **File > Configure API Manager** to configure API Manager settings.
9. For all KPS collections, update the read and write consistency levels to **LOCAL_QUORUM**. For example, in the Policy Studio tree, select **Environment Configuration > Key Property Stores > API Server > Data Sources > Cassandra Storage**, and click **Edit**.
10. Repeat this step for each KPS collection using Cassandra (for example, **Key Property Stores > OAuth** and **API Portal** for API Manager). This also applies to any custom KPS collections that you have created.
11. Click **Deploy** in the toolbar to deploy the updated configuration.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Policy Studio may need a longer transaction timeout in the Admin Node Manager server settings than the default time (4 minutes), especially for the first deploy that creates the API Manager Cassandra tables. In this case, it is recommended to increase the timeout to at least 10 minutes. See the [API Gateway Administrator Guide](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/) for more details. If Policy Studio shows a timeout error, the back-end would still complete and the success status can be verified in the API Manager instance trace file.{{< /alert >}}

### Update the Cassandra replication settings for the new API Gateway keyspace

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}This set up is only needed if the initial deployment did not set the multi-datacenter replication values.{{< /alert >}}

When the new API Gateway keyspace has been deployed, you must update its replication strategy and replication factor in the same way as the default `system_auth` keyspace. This time instead of the `system_auth` keyspace name, use the name of the newly created keyspace.

Perform the following steps:

1. On Cassandra node 1 in DC1, navigate to the `CASSANDRA_HOME/cassandra/bin` directory.
2. Log in to `cqlsh` using the IP address of the current node. For example:

    ```
    ./cqlsh 192.168.10.1
    ```

3. Run the following command:

    ```
    ALTER KEYSPACE "KEYSPACE_NAME" WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC1' : 3, 'DC2' : 3};
    ```

4. On each node, run `nodetool repair`.

    {{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}In a production environment, you should schedule weekly node repairs as a best practice.{{< /alert >}}

### Configure the remaining API Gateway nodes

When the API Gateway keyspace has been deployed and its replication updated, you can register the remaining hosts and add API Gateway instances using the `managedomain` command. Alternatively, you can do this using the API Gateway Manager web console.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You should always add one API Gateway instance at a time to the group.{{< /alert >}}

#### Configure the API Gateway environment variables in DC1

For each additional API Gateway instance in DC1, add the following to `envSettings.props` before starting the instance:

```
env.CASS.NAME1=Host 10.1
env.CASS.NAME2=Host 10.2
env.CASS.NAME3=Host 10.3
env.CASS.HOST1=192.168.10.1
env.CASS.HOST2=192.168.10.2
env.CASS.HOST3=192.168.10.3
env.CASS.REPL.FACTOR=DC1:3;DC2:3;
```

```
# API Manager Port
env.PORT.APIPORTAL=8075
# API Manager Traffic Port
env.PORT.PORTAL.TRAFFIC=8065
```

#### Configure the API Gateway environment variables in DC2

For each API Gateway instance in DC2, add the following settings to `envSettings.props` before starting the instance:

```
env.CASS.NAME1=Host 20.1
env.CASS.NAME2=Host 20.2
env.CASS.NAME3=Host 20.3
env.CASS.HOST1=192.168.20.1
env.CASS.HOST2=192.168.20.2
env.CASS.HOST3=192.168.20.3
env.CASS.REPL.FACTOR=DC1:3;DC2:3;
```

```
# API Manager Port
env.PORT.APIPORTAL=8075
# API Manager Traffic Port
env.PORT.PORTAL.TRAFFIC=8065
```

### Add the load balancer host to API Management whitelists

For each API Gateway host, you must add the external load balancer host to the whitelists for the Node Manager and API Manager to ensure that it will be accepted in the datacenter.

#### Add load balancer host to Node Manager whitelist

You can do this by creating an API Gateway project based on the Node Manager configuration and adding the external load balancer host to the Node Manager whitelist as a servlet property:

1. In Policy Studio, select **File > New Project**.
2. Enter a project **Name**, and click **Next**.
3. Select **From existing configuration** for the project starting point, and click **Next**.
4. Click the browse button, select the following directory, and click **Finish**:

    ```
    INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf/fed
    ```

5. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Environment Configuration > Listeners > Node Manager > Management Services > Paths**.
6. In the pane on the right, right-click the **api** servlet, and select **Edit**.
7. In the **Servlet** dialog, click **Add**, and enter the following in the **Properties** dialog:
    * **Name**: `CsrfProtectionFilterFactory.refererWhitelist`
    * **Value**: `https://LB_HOSTNAME:8090`
8. Right-click the **AppInfo Service** servlet, click **Edit**, and add the same whitelist setting as a property (see previous step).
9. When complete, the configuration is automatically saved to the `apiprojects` directory used by Policy Studio for your project. To get the Node Manager to read this change, you must copy the contents of your `apiprojects` subdirectory to `apigateway/conf/fed`.
10. Finally, you must restart the Node Manager for the configuration changes to be picked up.

The following shows an example of configuring the **api** servlet setting in Policy Studio:

![Add load balancer to node manager white list](/Images/APIGateway/multi-dc_add_lb_nm_whitelist.png)

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must ensure that every Node Manager has been updated to accept the load balancer host name. {{< /alert >}}

You can also add multiple load balancer hosts to the whitelist. For example:

* **Name**: `CsrfProtectionFilterFactory.refererWhitelist`
* **Value**: `https://dc1-lb.example.com:8090|https://dc2-lb.example.com:8090`

#### Add load balancer host to API Manager whitelist

You can do this by creating a new project from an API Gateway instance and adding the external load balancer host to the API Manager whitelist as a servlet property:

1. In Policy Studio, select **File > New Project from an API Gateway instance**.
2. Enter a project **Name**, and click **Next**.
3. In the **Connection Details** for the datacenter, enter the load balancer host name in the **Host** field and your credentials, and click **Next**.
4. Select the server instance in the datacenter that you wish to update, and click **Finish**.
5. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Environment Configuration > Listeners > API Gateway > APIÂ Portal > Paths**.
6. In the pane on the right, right-click the **API Portal v1.2 (âv1.2â)** servlet, and select **Edit**.
7. In the **Servlet** dialog, click **Add** and enter the following in the **Properties** dialog:
    * **Name**: `CsrfProtectionFilterFactory.refererWhitelist`
    * **Value**: `https://<LB_HOSTNAME>:8075`
8. Right-click the **API Portal v1.3 (âv1.3â)** servlet, click **Edit**, and add the same whitelist property (see previous step).
9. When complete, deploy the configuration to all API Gateways using the load balancer that you added to the whitelist.

The following shows an example of configuring the **API Portal v1.2 (âv1.2â)** servlet setting in Policy Studio:

![Add load balancer to API Manager white list](/Images/APIGateway/multi-dc_add_lb_mngr_whitelist.png)

### API Manager Single Sign On in multiple datacenters

For API Manager Single Sign On (SSO), when you have multiple API Managers under a specific load balancer, the `service-provider.xml` file must be the same for all API Manager instances under that load balancer. For the Keycloak identity provider, this means that the same client ID maps to the SAML profile, and that the URL should match the load balancer host name instead of the API Gateway host name.

For example, you have two datacenter sites, `apimgt.example.us` and `apimgt.example.eu`. Each site has a separate client, load balancer, and `service-provider.xml` file, and this file is shared by all API Manager instances under that load balancer.

For more details on API Manager SSO, see [Configure API Manager SSO](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/).

### Prevent simultaneous design-time changes in multiple datacenters

If you are using API Management in two or more datacenters at design time, there is a chance that changes made to the same object simultaneously could overwrite each other and potentially put the datacenters out of sync. This is because you cannot to predict the order in which any changes are applied due to the many different variables involved.

In this case, the data would likely become inconsistent between datacenters, and it would be difficult to know that an issue had occurred. There is also no guarantee that they would correctly synchronize at any time in the future. For this reason, it is best to make any design-time changes or updates to objects in your API Management system in one datacenter only.

## Optimize API Management performance in a multi-center environment

This section explains how to configure various API Gateway settings to optimize API Gateway and API Manager performance in a multi-center environment.

### Increase maximum received bytes per transaction to optimize API Manager

You can configure global API Gateway settings under the **Server Settings** node in Policy Studio.

In a multi-datacenter environment with a large amount of APIs and data, you may need to increase the value of **Maximum received bytes per transaction** to optimize the performance of the API Manager web console (for example, when viewing APIs in the API catalog). The default value is `20` MB (`20971520`bytes). For example, you might need to increase this setting, depending on the number of APIs and the volume of data in your multi-datacenter environment.

To configure this setting, in the Policy Studio tree, select the **Server Settings** node, and click **General** in the right pane. To confirm updates, click **Apply changes** at the bottom right.

After changing any settings, you must deploy to the API Gateway for the changes to be enforced. Click the **Deploy** button in the toolbar, or press F6.

### Increase API Manager polling time and events time for Cassandra replication

When API Manager is deployed in multiple datacenters, and changes to data stored in Cassandra are replicated across datacenters, there is a small risk that the API Gateway runtime in the datacenter where the data is replicated to might operate with outdated data. In this case, to update the data, you must restart all API Gateway instances in the affected datacenter.

To minimize this risk, you can use the `esexplorer` tool to increase the polling time in milliseconds in each API Gateway instance in the datacenter where the data is replicated to. The polling time value must be balanced with the need of having updated data in real time in the API Gateway runtime environment.

You must also change the Time To Live (TTL) of the API Manager events table to be consistent with Cassandra for failover situations. Cassandra uses a default value of three hours in its hinted handoff configuration.

To configure the API Manager polling time and events table settings, perform the following steps:

1. Change to the following directory:

    ```
    INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/posix/bin
    ```

2. Enter the `esexplorer` command.
3. Select **Store > Connect**, and browse to the following file:

    ```
    INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/<group-name>/conf/<group-id>/configs.xml
    ```

4. Select **System Components > Portal Config** in the tree on the left.
5. Select the **vapiPollerPeriodMs** setting in the pane on the right. Double-click the default value of `200`, and enter a value in the range of `1000` to `30000` milliseconds.
    {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}As a general rule, the higher the value of the polling time setting, the lower the risk of outdated data in the API Gateway runtime. However, it will take longer to update the data in the replicated datacenter.{{< /alert >}}
6. Select the **vapiEventTTLMs** setting on the right, and double-click to enter a value of `10800000` milliseconds (3 hours). This is consistent with the default value of the `max_hint_window_in_ms` setting in the `cassandra.yaml` file.
7. When you have completed these settings, you can open the updated API Gateway project in Policy Studio and deploy the updates to all the API Gateway instances in the affected datacenter.

### Increase Node Manager timeout for longer API Gateway startup

In a multi-datacenter environment, it may take longer for API Gateway to start. By default, the API Gateway active timeout is set to 4 mins. However, it may take longer for an API Gateway instance to start up in a multi-datacenter environment. For example, this may result in the Node Manager throwing a 503 error saying that the API Gateway cannot restart.

To configure the Node Manager timeout for longer startup time, perform the following steps:

1. Change to the following directory:

    ```
    INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/posix/bin
    ```

2. Enter the `esexplorer` command.
3. Select **Store > Connect**, and browse to the following file:

    ```
    INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf/fed/configs.xml
    ```

4. Select **Default System Settings** in the tree on the left.
5. Select the **activeTimeout** setting in the pane on the right. Double-click the default value of `240000` (4 minutes), and enter a higher value to better suit your multi-datacenter environment.
6. Select the **maxTransTimeout** setting on the right, and double-click to enter a higher value to suit your environment.
7. To update to all Node Managers in the group, you can copy the contents of the updated `apigateway/conf/fed` directory to the same directory on each node. Alternatively, you can run the `esexplorer` tool on each node to update the Node Manager settings.

## Configure Ehcache in multiple datacenters

Caching is replicated between API Gateway instances in each datacenter using the Ehcache distributed caching system. In the distributed cache, there is no master cache controlling all caches. Instead, each cache is a peer that needs to know where all the other peers are located. The examples in this section shows distributed caches for OAuth and Throttling. The cache settings are the same in both cases.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You should configure at least one distributed cache per datacenter, and should not replicate Ehcache information between datacenters. You should also configure sticky sessions in your load balancer environment to optimize performance.{{< /alert >}}

### Configure a distributed cache in each datacenter

In a distributed cache, each API Gateway has its own local copy of the cache and registers a cache event listener, which replicates messages to the other caches. This means that events on a single cache are duplicated across all other caches.

To add a distributed cache, perform the following steps:

1. Select the **Environment Configuration > Libraries > Caches** tree node, and click the **Add**
    button at the bottom right.
2. Select **Add Distributed Cache** from the menu, and configure the following settings on the **Configure Distributed Cache** dialog:

    * **Cache name**: Enter a name for the distributed cache (for example, `OAuth` or `Throttling`).
    * **Event Listener**: **Properties**: Enter the following setting using environment variables for the replication settings:

    ```
    replicateAsynchronously=${env.CACHE.ASYNC.REPLICATION},
    asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=${env.CACHE.ASYNC.INTERVAL},
    replicatePuts=true, replicateUpdates=true, replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true, replicateRemovals=true
    ```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}It is best to set `replicateAsynchronously` to true. The default `asychronousReplicationIntervaleMillis` value is `1000` ms if not specified. It is best to set this to the minimum of `10` ms. {{< /alert >}}

You can leave all other settings on this dialog as default. For example, the required settings are displayed as follows in Policy Studio:

![Disbributed cache for mutliple datacenters](/Images/APIGateway/multi-dc_dist_cache.png)

When the OAuth distributed cache has been configured, it can then be used by the OAuth Access Token Stores. For example, select **Environment Configuration > Libraries > OAuth2 Stores > Access Token Stores > OAuth Access Token Stores**, and right click to select **Edit Access Token Store**. Select **Store in a cache**, and click the browse button to select the OAuth distributed cache.

If the OAuth distributed cache is to be used by API Manager, you must also add it in **Server Settings > API Manager > OAuth Access Token Stores**.

Similarly, when a throttling distributed cache has been configured, it can then be used by the API Gateway Throttling filter.

### Configure distributed cache settings for peer discovery in each datacenter

To configure global distributed cache settings for peer discovery, perform the following steps:

1. In Policy Studio, select the **Server Settings** node , and click **General > Cache**.
2. Configure the following settings:

    * **Peer provider class**: **Properties**: Enter the following setting using an environment variable for the cache URLs:

        ```
        peerDiscovery=manual,timeToLive=1,rmiURLs=${env.CACHE.RMI.URL}
        ```

    * **Peer listener class**: **Properties**: Enter the following setting using environment variables for the hosts and ports:

        ```
        hostName=${env.CACHE.HOST},port=${env.CACHE.PORT},remoteObjectPort=${env.CACHE.REMOTE.OBJECT.PORT}
        socketTimeoutMillis=120000
        ```

3. You can leave all other settings as default. For example, the required settings are displayed as follows in Policy Studio:

    ![Distributed cache settings for peer discovery](/Images/APIGateway/cassandra_multi-dc_global_cache.png)

### Set the environment variables on each API Gateway host

You must set the environment variables used in the distributed cache in the following file on each host machine:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf/envSettings.props
```

For example:

```
env.CACHE.RMI.URL=//192.168.10.11:40001/OAuth|//192.168.10.11:40001/Throttle
env.CACHE.HOST=192.168.10.10
env.CACHE.PORT=40001
env.CACHE.REMOTE.OBJECT.PORT=40002
env.CACHE.ASYNC.REPLICATION=true
env.CACHE.ASYNC.INTERVAL=10
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The `env.CACHE.RMI.URL` environment variable should only include URLs for host machines in the same datacenter.{{< /alert >}}

## Configure API Manager quota in multiple datacenters {#api-manager-quota}

API Manager quotas enable you to manage the maximum message traffic rate that can be sent by applications to APIs for back-end protection. You can use the **Server Settings > API Manager > Quota Settings** in Policy Studio to configure how API Manager quota information is stored. By default, quotas are stored in external storage, and automatically adapt to the configured KPS storage mechanism. However, you can also explicitly configure a storage mechanism of Cassandra, RDBMS, or in memory only.

### API Manager quota storage

The following general guidelines apply to API Manager quota storage:

* Storing quota in memory only means that the quota calculation is performed by each API Gateway instance in each group between datacenters. If the quota duration is less than 30 seconds, in memory-only storage is automatically activated.
* It is best to use API Manager system quota (stored in Cassandra) when the back-end is shared between datacenters.
* It is best to use the API Gateway Throttling filter (stored in Ehcache) for back-end protection per datacenter.
