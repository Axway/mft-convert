## Summary

This document provides a reference architecture guide for deploying AMPLIFY API Management (APIM) using Externally Managed Topology ([EMT mode](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_getstarted/)). Deploying APIM using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes brings tremendous benefits in installing, developing and operating an API management solution.

This document describes all major areas in deploying and maintaining Axway APIM EMT on Amazon AWS cloud, including:

* Physical and deployment architectures
* Explanation and consideration for selecting underlying infrastructure components
* Kubernetes considerations
* Performance, logging and monitoring aspects
* Backup and recovery, including disaster recovery
* Constraints and roadmap

## Overview

AMPLIFY API Management is a leading API management solution on the market. It supports container-based deployment under an option called Externally Managed Topology (EMT). The purpose of this document is to share Axway reference architecture for the container-based deployment of an API management solution on Kubernetes. It will address many architectural, development and operational aspects of the proposed architecture.

Since the technology choices, Docker and Kubernetes, are portable across on-premises environments and many cloud providers, most of the information in this guide should apply to those  environments. But we include specific recommendations for AWS as one of the most common deployment targets.

The target audience for the document is architects, developers, and operations personnel. To get the most value from this document, a reader should have a good knowledge of Docker,  Kubernetes, and API management.

## General architecture

This chapter is focused on general architecture in support of an API management deployment on a dedicated Kubernetes cluster. The chapter discusses architectural principles, as well as  required and optional components. There are many ways to deploy software on a Kubernetes cluster, but this document shares Axway's experience acquired from deploying AMPLIFY API Management in an actual production environment. Most of the implementation details will be outlined in the following chapters.

Make sure the constraints listed in the chapters are respected in case of deployment on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

### Principles

The name of the new deployment option _EMT_ gives a good clue that with this option, many operational aspects of the architecture are externalized to an orchestration component. Existing users of AMPLIFY API Management should be aware that with EMT deployment, the role of Admin Node Manager becomes more of a monitoring tool, and Node Manager is completely removed from the EMT architecture.

Official testing is taking place in Kubernetes as the orchestration component. However, the Docker images are agnostic, so they can be deployed in other orchestration platforms, like Swarm. Kubernetes manages many important aspects of runtime, security, and operations:

* Autoscaling API Gateway with CPU or memory consumption threshold.
* Self-healing.
* Rolling updates with zero downtime.
* And many more.

In generic terms, reference architecture can be built by stacking four layers of different capabilities:

![Reference architecture layers](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image1.png)

Notice that the packaging of API Management for deployment has changed in the EMT mode. Customers need to build a new Docker image for any new `FED` or `POL` file that they want to deploy. For more information, see [Deploy API Gateway in containers](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/).

We recommend creating a DevOps pipeline that can be triggered anytime a new configuration is ready for deployment.

To manage Docker images, customers need to set up a Docker registry as a repository for created images. To help customers with setting up a required environment, the following table  describes the required and recommended options.

| Description                                                                                                 | Required?   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A DevOps pipeline is strongly recommended for building Docker images                                        | Recommended |
| A bastion is required for administration tasks on API management and Kubernetes                             | Required    |
| A storage system is required with the capacity to store dedicated data and to share data between components | Required    |
| Kubernetes must have a container registry to pull Docker images.                                            | Required    |

Besides [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), we use [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts to describe the entire deployment  configuration. Using Helm provides an efficient way to package all configuration parameters for Kubernetes and API Management containers to be deployed with a single command.

### Target use case

We review a single deployment option where all API Management components are running inside a single Kubernetes cluster. This pattern allows one to virtualize back-end apps or APIs hosted inside or outside the cluster. It's possible to deploy multiple API gateway groups in the same cluster. But keep in mind that every API gateway group configuration should be deployed as a separate Docker image.

In our scenario, we expose several entry points for the external clients inside the cluster (see implementation details in the next chapter). All API Gateways write their transaction events to a shared volume. Admin Node Manager streams those events to a relational database management system. API Gateway Manager UI can be used to view the traffic monitor and events data.

A dedicated deployment environment requires:

* Kubernetes cluster
* Docker registry
* Cassandra cluster
* RDBMS
* Storage system for shared volume
* Monitoring system
* Bastion system for cluster access
* DevOps pipelines to control Docker image build and deployment to a target environment

The following diagram shows a general architecture of a single cluster configuration:

![Single cluster configuration](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image2.jpg)

### Additional components and considerations

In this section, we present considerations for using additional components in the single cluster architecture.

#### Container registry

This registry is used to store Docker images and Helm packages. You may consider maintaining at least two pipelines: one for building images and the other for deploying them to a target environment. The image building pipeline would build and push images to the registry. The deployment pipeline would deploy a specific Helm package. In this scenario, Docker images are pulled by Kubernetes and deployed to a cluster. One of the requirements in this environment is to securely pass container registry credentials during Helm package deployment. We suggest using Kubernetes secrets. Besides registry access credentials, you will need to maintain additional sensitive data that is described in the following table.

| Description                                                                                                            | Required?   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Docker images contain such sensitive data as license key, certificate, and configuration. This data must be protected. | Required    |
| Operations should define a clear tag strategy for Docker images tagging.                                               | Recommended |
| The password is sensitive and must be encrypted in the system.                                                         | Required    |

#### Bastion host

Administrative tasks should be executed safely. We use a bastion host to bridge to the following instances via the internet:

* Kubernetes master nodes for managing a cluster.
* Kubernetes Dashboard.
* RDBMS and Cassandra.
* Debugging any issue with a Kubernetes cluster.

The bastion must have high traceability with specific RBAC permissions to allow a few selected users to access infrastructure components.

#### DevOps pipeline

A DevOps pipeline is based on a suite of tools to build and push gateway configuration and APIs to a target deployment environment and run a set of verification tests. Since a Docker container is immutable, any change in API gateway configuration requires building a new Docker image.

Axway provides several CLI tools that fit nicely into a DevOps pipeline. Later in the document, we will describe:

* Docker build scripts
* API promotion tool (`apimanager-promote`)
* GitHub projects

#### SMTP relay

The API Manager component can send alerts and messages. By default, the solution only supports SMTP(S) to send an email. But customization can be done in alerts policies to send an email by API.

### Performance goals

An important factor for achieving your goals with the EMT deployment is to define a set of performance goals. These will be unique for a specific set of APIs, deployment platform, and clients' expectations. Later in the document, we show an example of the performance metrics that have been achieved in testing a reference architecture by the Axway Managed Cloud team.

## Implementation details

This section details the configuration for each component.

The following is the recommended reference architecture diagram. It is designed with High Availability (HA) in mind. An HA deployment requires redundancy and high throughput for all infrastructure components and networks. To reach this target, components must be deployed in multiple zones. In our configuration, we use three availability zones. This configuration is compliant with a minimal technical SLA of 99.99 percent.

![Recommended reference architecture](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image3.png)

### Choice of runtime infrastructure components

This section provides recommendations for a typical implementation of the runtime infrastructure components.

In this configuration, all assets of the Kubernetes cluster are deployed in the same data center or a region (in case of a cloud deployment), although components are spread out in various racks, rooms or availability zones.

The following table lists the number of runtime components in this configuration.

| Assets                              | Spec |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- |
| Bastion                             | 1    |
| Cassandra nodes                     | 3    |
| Dedicated storage                   | 70GB |
| Docker registry                     | 1    |
| External IP (public or private)     | 1    |
| External identity access management | 1    |
| Load balancer                       | 1    |
| Master nodes                        | 3    |
| RDBMS instance                      | 2    |
| Shared storage                      | 20GB |
| Worker nodes                        | 3    |
| Worker pipeline                     | 1    |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}These values are the minimum recommended starting point. Your actual values will depend on many factors, like the number of APIs, payload size, and so on.{{< /alert >}}

#### VM sizes

These are the recommended parameters for the VMs:

* Master node: 2vCPU and 8GB memory (for master node according to Kubernetes sizing recommendation for 10 workers nodes; see [Building large clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/))
* Worker node (for API Gateway/Manager/ANM): 2vCPU and 8GB memory
* Worker node (for monitoring tools): 2vCPU and 8GB memory
* Cassandra node: 2vCPU and 8GB memory with 5GB/s
* SQL database node (estimation based for Mysql): 2vCPU (mono-core) and 4GB memory

#### Storage

SSD disks with low latency are recommended for storing data.

##### Cassandra and RDBMS

Cassandra is a distributed database, so each node requires its own storage. Axway recommends a cluster with three nodes, so three volumes of 50GB must be allocated. RDBMS uses less storage so 20GB for a simple instance is acceptable.

##### Events logs

API gateways generate events. A shared volume is required. The volume is limited by a setting inside the deployment package (FED file). By default, this value is set to 1GB. Three gateways are deployed in the minimal configuration. But autoscaling can increase this number to 12 replicas. So, storage of 13 GB must be configured.

Follow this method to estimate disk space:

![Server Settings - Transaction Event Log](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image4.png)

```
Max_disk_space x API_gateway_max_replica + 1GB = recommended_disk_space
```

It is important to select a proper disk option for logs in your target environment (cloud or on-premises). In the Kubernetes environment, there may be many pods simultaneously writing to shared storage. Selected disks must support this target workload.

##### Storage for logs

A volume is required to store all logs streamed out from a Kubernetes cluster. The data will contain:

* Kubernetes logs
* Containers logs
* Applications logs

FluentD has been used in our environment to stream logs.

##### Total storage requirements

This table summarizes the total required storage space.

| Components       | Kind      | Size          |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Cassandra        | Dedicated | 50GB per node |
| Events           | Shared    | 13GB          |
| SQL Database     | Dedicated | 20GB per node |
| Storage for logs | Dedicated | 100GB         |

#### Load balancer

A load balancer is required in front of the cluster. We use the Kubernetes object called ingress controller that is responsible for fulfilling the ingress rules. A layer 7 load balancer (AWS ALB) is configured in this architecture. It performs important tasks of terminating TLS connection and request routing. A layer 4 load balancer is used inside a Kubernetes cluster to route all requests on a specific IP.

![Load balancer](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image5.JPG)

#### Network

This typical network deployment is based on a minimal number of segregated zones. It consists of four subnets:

* Kubernetes master subnet.
* Bastion subnet where administration tasks will be done.
* Kubernetes worker nodes subnet.
* Data subnet to host all databases and other kinds of storage.

![Subnets](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image6.png)

Each subnet must be protected by a firewall with appropriate inbound and outbound rules. See details in the following diagram (just one availability zone is shown) and table.

| ID  | Description                                                      | From                    | To                      | Protocol | Ports     |

### Kubernetes considerations

This section focuses on additional Kubernetes objects and configuration inside the cluster to support Axway components. This is a required step before deploying containers.

#### Deployment options

Some parameters are available only at the creation of the Kubernetes cluster. The first is a network manager for communication between pods and the second is a set of strong permissions for Kubernetes.

| Description                                                                                                                                          | Type        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Network CNI mode with a specific plugin (CALICO or Cloud provider) to secure pod connections with other applications or resources inside the cluster | Recommended |
| Secure Kubernetes with RBAC capabilities                                                                                                             | Recommended |

##### Network plugin

By default in Kubernetes, there is no isolation between pods inside the cluster. It's not a problem to deploy it on a dedicated cluster; default Kubernetes networking will be enough. API management capabilities do not require specific rules. But in some cases, API management may be deployed with other back end or apps in the same cluster. In this case, it's necessary to use a Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin.

There are three kinds of policies that can be applied:

* Drop communication by default.
* Allow connection to API gateway from specific namespaces.
* Allow connection to pods from specific monitoring tools.

The Axway team used CALICO without any specific rule. It was simple to deploy with a manifest.

##### RBAC permission

RBAC permission is a secure mechanism to manage authorization inside Kubernetes. It's recommended to set people or application permissions to manage resources:

* Allow Helm to manage resources
* Allow worker nodes autoscaling
* Allow specific users to view pods, to deploy pods, to access Kubernetes Dashboard
* Allow cert-manager to pull and encrypt certificate
* Allow Kubernetes to provide cloud resources, like storage or load balancer

This is a minimal configuration and you can define more specific permissions with cluster roles or binding in the cluster.

#### Namespaces

A namespace allows splitting of a Kubernetes cluster into separated virtual zones. It's possible to configure multiple namespaces that will be logically isolated from each other. Pods from different namespaces can communicate with a full DNS pattern (`<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local`). A name is unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

As mentioned in [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/), a typical usage of namespaces is separating projects and configured objects deployed by different teams.

Axway recommends deploying all API management components inside the same namespace:

* According to Kubernetes best-practice, the deployment is the responsibility of API team
* It's easiest to deploy the solution inside an existing cluster
* You don't have to specify full DNS to call other components, therefore, preventing errors. You just use a service name (`<service-name>`).

| Description                                             | Type        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Provide all API management assets in the same namespace | Recommended |

#### Pod resource limits

Axway API Gateway runs in a Java VM. A Java VM pool is limited with the `Xmx` parameter: If there is a memory leak, it can affect the entire cluster. JVM heap size should be limited.

Kubernetes permits defining a CPU and memory limits for each pod to protect the cluster. Setting up the limits is especially important in case a cluster is shared with other apps. When scheduling a pod deployment, Kubernetes uses these limits to ensure that resources for the pod are available on a target node.

| Description                                                                      | Type        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Change Xmx value and resources limitations according to the size of worker nodes | Recommended |
| Limit memory and CPU usage to protect the cluster                                | Recommended |

These are the recommended initial limits for AMPLIFY API Management components:

* API Manager pod: 2cpu with 2GB memory and initial request of 0,5cpu with 0,5GB memory
* Admin Node Manager: memory resource limit of 2GB memory

#### Components health check

Kubernetes provides a very useful feature called probes. There is one probe to check if a pod is ready to be used at startup and another to periodically check if a container is still operational. These probes are respectively called _readiness probe_ and _liveness probe_.

These probes are configured on all ports (traffic and UI) and use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

| Description                                                         | Type     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Implement Kubernetes probes to manage container status in real time | Required |

#### Affinity and anti-affinity mode

Kubernetes pod allocation strategy is based on the availability of nodes' resources. Potentially, more than one pod replica can be deployed on the same node. For an HA deployment, you want to spread your runtime components across multiple nodes and availability zones. For this reason, we recommend using a Kubernetes option called _podAntiAffinity_. You should instruct Kubernetes _not_ to schedule the same replicas on the same node if it is possible based on the resource availability.

| Description                                                                                | Type     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Dispatch APIM pods across available nodes (monitoring node can be excluded from this rule) | Required |

#### Autoscaling

To properly increase or decrease the number of runtime components to accommodate a workload, there are two scaling techniques used in the reference architecture:

* Nodes/VMs autoscaling
* Kubernetes pod autoscaling

##### Node scaling

If the allocated number of nodes/VMs is not enough for increasing traffic, there are different ways to scale them. We recommend using a platform-provided mechanism to control this. On AWS we use Auto Scaling Groups. There are many ways to design autoscaling. The Axway team uses an approach where a new node is added when the Kubernetes scheduler can't schedule a new pod on the existing nodes.

##### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) you can automatically scale the number of API Gateway components. HPA uses a control loop that checks selected utilization metrics every 15s (default value). There are several options for triggering autoscaling. The average CPU utilization can be used. It is set to a high enough value for optimal resource usages. When CPU utilization exceeds this threshold, Kubernetes adds more pods. You need to test what should be a good CPU utilization based on your pod start-up time, traffic pattern and potential impact on the overall performance. An average CPU utilization of 75 percent is a good starting point. Keep in mind that to get HPA working, you need to define resource limits (notice, that our CPU limit is 2cpu). This is an example of this setting in Helm:

```
metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 75
```

#### External traffic

We use the ingress controller to expose API management apps and services to external clients. It dynamically creates externally reachable URLs for desirable endpoints, load balance traffic between pods and terminate TLS connections. This mode is available only for HTTP and HTTPS.

| Description                                                                             | Type     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Need specific DNS entry to route requests (solution with rewrite path isn't functional) | Required |
| Terminate TLS before a request reaches pods                                             | Required |

A specific DNS entry is required to route requests to a service inside a Kubernetes cluster. These are the exposed interfaces in our configuration:

* `anm.FQDN` for API Gateway Manager UI
* `apimgmt.FQDN` for API Manager UI
* `apimgr.FQDN` for API traffic

DNS records must match the certificate and ingress host configuration. These records must target the external IP used for the Kubernetes entry point.

{{% alert title="Note" %}} It is not possible to use some rewrite path like `https://FQDN/Components/` to access the web interface {{% /alert %}}

It is necessary to configure the following annotations for ingress configuration:

* Disable HTTP/2 if your ingress chooses it by default.
* Authorized entry port (recommended to allow only HTTPS).
* An HTTPS redirection if HTTPS is authorized with the previous rules.
* Force usage of TLS protocol v1.2.
* Specify HTTPS protocol for a back end.
* Localization of each certificate.
* A range IP authorization (optional, but recommended only for private access).

Kubernetes lists [available ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/). For the AWS implementation, we used the AWS ALB Ingress Controller, but you can pick any Ingress controller option that fits your requirements.

#### Secrets

Without secrets, all passwords are set in clear in Manifest. Kubernetes define _secret_ objects to encode in base64 all sensitive information. Using secrets is very useful for variables in containers, Docker registry login, and technical token for shared storage.

Here is a table to list all the secrets used by pods:

| Secret                | Admin Node Manager | API Gateway Manager | API Gateway Traffic | Ingress controller |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Cassandra user ID     |                    | X                   | X                   |                    |
| Docker registry login | X                  | X                   | X                   |                    |
| Public certificate    |                    |                     |                     | X                  |
| SGBDR user ID         | X                  |                     |                     |                    |

A more secure solution for handling sensitive data instead of secrets is [Sealed Secrets for Kubernetes](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) artifacts.

Customers may also use a key management service available on their platform of choice as a more secure solution to store sensitive data.

### API Management implementation details

This chapter describes API management components in Kubernetes. Following is a deployment diagram with a complete representation of the API management objects:

![API management deployment](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image7.png)

#### Admin Node Manager

Admin Node Manager provides the API Gateway Manager web interface with monitoring capabilities. This component requires an RDBMS to store analytical data. It is accessed through an ingress controller. We recommend that ANM is available from an internal and secure location, for example, through bastion node).

To build an ANM container, you must provide:

* HTTPS certificate. This certificate will be used inside the cluster, so it's possible to use a self-signed certificate. However, we recommend reviewing the usage of self-signed certs with your security team.
* A license file with the EMT mode. Notice it is not required to start Admin Node Manager, but may be required for optional features such as FIPS mode.
* JDBC library for the selected RDBMS.
* RDBMS connection parameters.

To deploy an ANM container, you must provide:

* Heap size memory as mentioned before (set the value at 1024).
* Persistent storage with read/write multiple pods capabilities to store events.
* RDBMS parameters.
* Log format in JSON.
* Trace level setting.

The Helm charts contain a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before this pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running RDBMS server.

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe
* Kubernetes object: deployment
* Resources limit: 1cpu & 2GB memory
* Java heap size: 1024 MB
* Automatic scalability: no
* Replicas: 1

#### API Manager UI

This pod supports an API Manager web interface (port 8075).

{{% alert title="Note" color="" %}}
As of Axway [API Management v7.7](/docs/apim_relnotes/201904_release/apig_relnotes/), we recommend running only one API Manager UI pod. This pod is not used to process client requests, so using one pod is enough. It also simplifies architecture. {{% /alert %}}

To build an API Manager container, you must provide:

* HTTPS certificate. This certificate will be used inside the cluster. It's possible to use a self-signed certificate. However, we recommend reviewing the usage of self-signed certs with your security team.
* A license file with the EMT mode set.
* A group name. It's mandatory because Admin Node Manager needs it to manage gateway.
* JDBC library for the selected RDBMS.
* A FED file with server settings and policies. It is also possible to use policy and environment package files. So, you can have one common policy package and several environment packages: one for each deployment environment.

To deploy you must provide:

* Cassandra hosts and Keyspace name.
* Heap size memory as mentioned before (set the value at 1024).
* ANM hostname.
* RDBMS parameters.
* Log format in JSON.

The Helm charts contain a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before this pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running three Cassandra hosts.
* Up and running RDBMS server.
* Up and running ANM pod.

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe
* Kind: deployment
* Exposed port UI 8075 (customers may configure a different port if needed)
* Resources limits: 2cpu & 2GB memory
* Java heap size: 1024 MB
* Session affinity: by cookie
* Replicas: 1

API Manager UI pod can send an email via SMTP relay. It's configured inside a `FED` file.

#### Traffic handling

API Gateway/Manager pod handles API calls. At the least, a traffic port (port 8065) should be exposed to this container. But if needed, additional ports can be exposed (secure and insecure ports 8443, 8080 and 8081). This component uses a volume mount point with read/write multiple pods capabilities to store events. Other data to persist is streamed out by FluentD. With this approach, you can reduce the size of persistence data required for log/event data.

The API Gateway/Manager container is the same as the API Manager UI container. The deployment parameters are the same. The only differences are in the Helm charts configuration: these are primarily the number of replicas and exposed ports.

{{% alert title="Caution" color="warning" %}}
During development of the policies and server settings, you must use `EMT_DEPLOYMENT_ENABLED` flag when a container is started. This flag enables direct deployment of the API Gateway configurations from Policy Studio. You will be able to develop and test your policies as with the classic deployment option. This option is recommended for running a small test environment using _only one_ API Gateway pod on a development machine.

You must not use this flag in a production environment.

Any testing in an upper environment (Test, QA, and so on) must be done using a Docker image built for that environment.
{{% /alert %}}

The Helm charts contain a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before this pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running three Cassandra hosts.
* Up and running RDBMS server.
* Up and running ANM pod.
* UP and running API Manager UI pod.

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe
* Kind: deployment
* Exposed traffic port 8065 (customers may configure a different port if needed)
* Resources limits: 2cpu & 2GB memory
* Java heap size: 1512 MB
* Automatic scalability: yes
* Replica number: minimum/initial value is 3

### Cassandra considerations

Cassandra must be hosted outside the cluster. Minimum three nodes are required: one node in each availability zone. See [Administer Apache Cassandra](/docs/cass_admin/).

### Security considerations

The following is a summary of security considerations discussed within this document:

* In layered infrastructure, the network is protected by firewall LVL4 that filters only specifics ports. Any administrative access to infrastructure components is enabled through a subnet called a bastion.
* All components are deployed in a cluster mode. Kubernetes uses RBAC permission to set roles per user or group. CNI plugin protects communications inside the cluster. All external connections are protected by an ingress controller with a public certificate.
* In the application layer, sensitive data is protected inside a secret. All communications are encrypted in a cluster. API Management uses only TLS 1.2.
* Do not run containers as privileged.
* Only allow communication on required ports.

### SQL database considerations

AMPLIFY API Management supports several RDBMS:

* MySQL or MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle database

For AWS deployment, API Manager uses Amazon RDS for MySQL to store analytics data. It is configured with High Availability on two nodes across two different availability zones. A MySQL schema is packaged along with the Helm charts. It is imported by running a Kubernetes job that runs a `dbsetup` command to create a schema. It is also possible to import a schema through a MySQL client.

### Logging and tracing

The following logs should be persisted:

* Trace files.
* Admin Node Manager: `INSTALL_DIR/trace`.
* API Gateway instance: `INSTALL_DIR/groups/<group-id>/<instance-id>/trace`.
* Transaction audit log - see [Transaction audit log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-audit-log-settings).
* Transaction access log - see [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-access-log-settings).
* Transaction event log - see [Transaction event log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-event-log-settings)
* Open traffic event log - see [Open traffic event log settings](/docs/apim_reference/monitor_traffic_events_metrics/#open-traffic-event-log-settings)

### Environmentalization and promotion

Environmentalization and promotion go hand in hand. AMPLIFY API Management uses two different artifacts:

* **Polices** - used by API Gateway
* **API data files** - used by API Manager

![Promotion](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image8.png)

The following steps show how the polices are promoted from the development environment to the testing environment.

1. Policy developer edits configuration and deploys in development environment via Policy Studio.
2. Policy developer tests the polices in development environment.
3. Policy developer enables the display of configuration settings that are assigned for environmentalization in Policy Studio: open **Window > Preferences > Environmentalization** in the main menu, and select **Allow environmentalization of fields**.
4. Policy developer environmentalizes environment-specific settings. For example:
    * **URL**, **User Name**, and **Password** fields in a Default Database Connection.
    * The **URL** field in a Connect to URL filter.
    * **X.509 Certificate** field in an HTTPS interface.
    * **URL**, **User Name**, **Password**, and **Signing Key** fields for an LDAP configuration.
5. Policy developer checks in the code to Git.
6. CI pipeline checks out the code from Git, and uses [projpack](/docs/apigtw_devops/deploy_package_tools/) CLI to create a pol and env package.

    This can be done in the Policy Studio. When the active configuration is loaded, select **File > Save > Policy Package** to save the pol file and select **File > Save > Environment Package** to save the env file.
7. Policy Developer uses env package to create an environment-specific artifact (like `test.env` and `prod.env`).
8. Policy Developer creates a Docker container using pol and env package. For more information, see [Create and start API Gateway Docker container](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_script_gwimage/).

    Example:

    ```
    ./build_gw_image.py --license=license.lic --default-cert --pol=banking.fed --env=test.env --merge-dir /home/axway/apigateway
    ```

9. Policy Developer pushes Docker image to your Docker registry.
10. Policy Developer deploys to test environment by pulling an environment-related tag from the Docker registry.

API Manager promotion:

* API as code. You can use [apim-cli GitHub project](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apim-cli) to create and promote an API across environments.
* Promote API using export and import mechanism. For more information, see [Promote managed APIs between environments](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_promote/).
* Promote API using REST API. See, [Sample implementation](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apim-deployment).

### Infrastructure components for AWS deployment

These are the infrastructure components that the Axway team has tested and recommends for the initial configuration of the reference architecture:

* Kubernetes master and worker nodes - `m5.large` EC2 instances.
* Cassandra nodes - `m5.large` EC2 instances.
* RDBMS - Amazon RDS running on `db.t3.large` EC2 instances.

### Performance testing

The Axway team ran a variety of performance tests on the reference architecture. These tests were executed with testing tools Postman or JMeter. A test is configured for 300 seconds with a loop of 5 000 000 repetitions and 20 threads.

| Message size | Configuration | Minimal Threshold (transactions/sec) | Results (transactions/sec) |

## Maintenance

After you deploy AMPLIFY API Management in production, you will need to update product configurations (policies and settings) and install fixes and service packs. This section outlines best practices in maintaining your installation.

### New configurations

With a shift to a container-based deployment, the notion of pushing API Gateway/Manager configuration updates directly to the running instances has changed. Now you need to create a new Docker image that contains the latest Gateway/Manager configuration. Using [Kubernetes rolling upgrades](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/), you deploy a new Docker image to a cluster without interrupting your request processing. To learn how to create and deploy a new Docker image, see [Development and deployment with API Gateway containers](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_development/).

In general, the process of building AMPLIFY API Management Docker images for installation can be depicted as in the picture below.

![Docker images](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image9.tmp)

Description of the images:

* A base image includes a base product installation and does not change frequently. You update a base image only when you need to install an update for the underlying operating system, or when you need to install a service pack for AMPLIFY API Management or upgrade the product.
* An ANM image represents Admin Node Manager, but in the container-based deployment, it is not used for pushing new configurations to the gateways. It is primarily a monitoring tool.
* Gateway or API Manager images contain configuration and settings (`.pol` and `.evn`, or `.fed`) that are updated frequently. These are the type of images that you would rebuild frequently.

Axway provides sample build scripts as a working example to be modified and used by customers. The sample scripts are provided from the Axway support site. For example, a download file for AMPLIFY API Management v7.7 is `APIGateway_7.7-1_DockerScripts.tar.gz`.

To streamline this process for building Docker images, Axway recommends creating a CI/CD pipeline that should, at least, include these tasks:

* Creating a policy package (`.pol`).
* Creating an environment package (`.env`) for every target deployment environment.
* Creating an environment-specific Docker image; for example, for a test, QA, or production.
* Deploying a new Docker image to a target environment and smoke testing.

Customers should use a source control management (SCM) system for maintaining/versioning policy and environment packages and a Docker registry for Docker images.

### Product updates

There are variations in how to install a new patch, service pack, or upgrade for a new AMPLIFY API Management version. But the overall approach is that:

* For an upgrade or SP installation, you rebuild your base, ANM and Gateway/Manager images.
* For a patch installation, you rebuild your ANM and Gateway/Manager images.

#### Installing a patch

Patch installation requires updating one or more files in the target product installation directory. To apply a patch, you need to overwrite one or more files when you build an ANM or Gateway/Manager images. The build scripts provide the `--merge-dir` option that allows you to overwrite any files in a Docker image. The example and additional explanation of the procedure can be found in [Apply a patch, update, or service pack](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_patch_sp/).

The following is an example of a build command for a Gateway/Manager image:

```
./build_gw_image.py
  --license=/tmp/api_gw.lic
  --domain-cert=certs/mydomain/mydomain-cert.pem
  --domain-key=certs/mydomain/mydomain-key.pem
  --domain-key-pass-file=/tmp/pass.txt
  --parent-image=my-base:latest
  --fed=my-group-fed.fed
  --fed-pass-file=/tmp/my-group-fedpass.txt
  --group-id=my-group
  --merge-dir=/tmp/apigateway
```

![Directories](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image10.png)

The `--merge-dir` points to a directory that contains files that will replace specific installation files on a target Docker image. A merge directory must be named `apigateway`. For example, if you need to update the `envSettings.props` file in a Gateway image, this is what you should have in your merge directory.

The `/tmp/apigateway` directory should mirror the file path in your target Docker image.

##### Step-by-step example

Let's look at applying one of the patches for APIM v7.7 - `APIGateway 7.7 SP1 Patch17276`:

1. Download a patch from the Axway Support website.
2. Create a merge directory:

    ```
    mkdir /tmp/apigateway
    ```

3. Extract downloaded file into the merge directory:

    ```
    tar -xvzf APIGateway_7.7-SP1_Patch17276_d16e79fb_allOS_BN20191024.tgz -C /tmp/apigateway/
    ```

4. The merge directory shows that two files will be written to a target Docker image during build:

    ![tree](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-aws/image11.png)

5. Run your build script specifying the merge directory that you have created:

    ```
    ./build_gw_image.py
    --license=/tmp/api_gw.lic
    --domain-cert=certs/mydomain/mydomain-cert.pem
    --domain-key=certs/mydomain/mydomain-key.pem
    --domain-key-pass-file=/tmp/pass.txt
    --parent-image=my-base:latest
    --fed=my-group-fed.fed
    --fed-pass-file=/tmp/my-group-fedpass.txt
    --group-id=my-group
    --merge-dir=/tmp/apigateway
    --out-image=my-gtw:7.7-SP1-p17276
    ```

6. Two files from the patch will overwrite (or create) corresponding files in the new Docker image.

#### Installing a service pack

Installing a service pack is identical to creating your first API Gateway/Manager Docker image. The only difference is that you just need to download and use a combined installation file that includes base product plus a corresponding service pack. As an example, we look at AMPLIFY API Management v7.7 and API Management v7.7 with SP1 install files:

* API Management v7.7 install is titled: *API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 Install (linux-x86-64)* with the following file - `APIGateway_7.7_Install_linux-x86-64_BN4.run`.
* API Management v7.7 with SP1install is titled: *API Gateway 7.7 Install Service Pack 1 (linux-x86-64)* with the following file - `APIGateway_7.7_SP1_linux-x86-64_BN201908271.run`.

The build process will be identical to the one described in [new configurations](#new-configurations).

#### Upgrading the product

Upgrading your existing deployment to a new version of AMPLIFY API Management will be similar to a process described in [new configurations](#new-configurations). But there are some additional steps to migrate your existing Gateway/Manager configuration using Policy Studio.

[Upgrade a container deployment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_upgrade/) describes this process for API Management v7.7. The extra steps are needed to import your existing `.fed` file in Policy Studio. This will trigger an automatic update to your `FED` file. When done, export the updated `FED` (or `.pol` and `.env`) file and use it for building a new Docker image.

There may be additional upgrade steps related to other parts of your deployment (for example, Cassandra or RDBMS).

#### Adding customization

You may want to add or customize some files in the product installation directory. To do this with a container-based deployment, follow steps outlined in [Installing a patch] (#installing-a-patch). The only difference is the need to create manually a proper directory structure of your merge directory.

### Pushing a new Docker image to your Kubernetes cluster

When there is time to push a new image to a Kubernetes cluster (in any environment), we rely on Kubernetes rolling updates that are supported under the Deployment object. This object has a section that governs the process of updating running containers with a new Docker image. This is an example of an update strategy specification:

```
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

With the rolling update, Kubernetes will take down a designated number of pods, update them with a new image, and start. Then continue this process with other pods. The optional `maxUnavailable` parameter specifies that only one pod at a time can be updated. Instead of an absolute value for `maxUnavailable`, you can provide a percentage value that will represent a portion of your Deployment pods that can be updated at once. With four pods in Deployment set and `maxUnavailable: 25%` (the default value for `maxUnavailable` if it is omitted), Kubernetes will update one pod at a time.

There is another optional parameter - `maxSurge`(default value is 25 percent). For example, if there are four pods in your Deployment, then during a rolling update, the maximum number of pods with old and new configurations combined cannot be more than five:

```
4 pods (100%) + 1 pod (25% - maxSurge) = 5 pods (125%)
```

See the [Zero-downtime Deployment in Kubernetes with Jenkins](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/30/zero-downtime-deployment-kubernetes-jenkins/) article to learn more about rolling updates and other techniques for a zero downtime deployment.

## Configuration and data backups

It is essential for the smooth operation of an API management solution to perform regular backups of data and configurations. At a minimum, the following data, source code and artifacts should be included:

* Policies and server configuration - there are a couple of ways to maintain your deployment artifacts. You can maintain an API Gateway configuration as a Policy Studio folder in a source code management system (SCM). GitHub and GitLab are two popular choices. As an alternative, you can version control `FED` or `POL`/`ENV` files.

In addition to the source code, you need to maintain deployment artifacts in the form of a Docker image, since this is what you deploy in the EMT mode. Thus, a Docker registry is required.

* RDBMS backup - use the appropriate backup procedure for the selected RDBMS.
* Cassandra - follow recommendations in [Cassandra backup and restore](/docs/cass_admin/cassandra_bur/). You will need to decide how frequently you should back up Cassandra. This decision will be impacted by what data you store in Cassandra. Is it only API Manager data? Or does it include OAuth tokens and custom KPS? The main discussion point is to decide how much data you could potentially lose without seriously affecting your business. A daily backup may be a good starting point. There are a couple of good blogs on backing up and restoring Cassandra:

    * [Cassandra Backup and Restore - Backup in AWS using EBS Volumes](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2018/04/03/cassandra-backup-and-restore-aws-ebs.html)
    * [Medusa - Spotify's Apache Cassandra backup tool is now open source](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2019/11/05/cassandra-medusa-backup-tool-is-open-source.html)
* Log/trace/event files - your backup strategy will depend on your choice of infrastructure. For running on AWS, we use AWS S3 service that has high durability and reliability metrics (see [Data Durability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/DataDurability.html)). Log files are not required to run API Gateway. Thus, if you use AWS S3 service (or similar), there is no need to back up log files. If log file storage is temporarily unavailable, it shouldn't affect the runtime.
* Helm charts and other environment-specific files should be part of an SCM with its own backup mechanism.

## Disaster recovery

For a disaster recovery procedure, you should have access to cloud resources in another region. Using backed-up configurations/data and Docker registry, you should be able to run a CI/CD pipeline for creating a new Kubernetes cluster in another region.

## Known constraints and roadmap

As of AMPLIFY API Management v7.7, there are some differences or constraints compared to the classic mode deployment:

* API Portal and Embedded Analytics are not yet supported in the EMT mode.
* Distributed Ehcache is not supported. However, you can use Apache Cassandra as a distributed data store where CRUD operations are supported to directly interact with KPS, using scripts.
* Running with Embedded ActiveMQ configured in an instance is not advised. The recommendation is to use an external JMS provider.

The current version does not support all the configurations that currently exist for the classic deployment. Axway plans to address these limitations by delivering the following  capabilities in the future:

* Broader support of current APIM configurations.
* Running API Portal in a Docker container.
* Native support of Embedded Analytics.
* Advancements in the current EMT mode.
* Mutable policy configuration - that enables a policy to be modified without the need to bake in a new Docker image.
* Reference architecture document for other cloud providers.

To know more, see [roadmaps on Axway Community Portal](https://community.axway.com/s/product-roadmaps).
