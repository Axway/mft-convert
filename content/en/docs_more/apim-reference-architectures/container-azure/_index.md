## Summary

This document provides a reference architecture guide for deploying AMPLIFY API Management (APIM) using Externally Managed Topology ([EMT mode](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_getstarted/)). Deploying APIM using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes brings tremendous benefits in installing, developing, and operating an API management solution.

This document describes all major areas in deploying and maintaining Axway APIM EMT on Microsoft Azure cloud, including:

* Physical and deployment architectures.
* Explanation and consideration for selecting underlying infrastructure components.
* Kubernetes considerations.
* Performance, logging and monitoring aspects.
* Backup and recovery, including disaster recovery.
* Constraints and roadmap.

## Overview

AMPLIFY API Management is a leading API management solution on the market. It supports container-based deployment under an option called Externally Managed Topology (EMT). The purpose of this document is to share Axway reference architecture for the container-based deployment of an API management solution on Kubernetes. It will address many architectural, development, and operational aspects of the proposed architecture.

Since the technology choices, Docker and Kubernetes, are portable, most of the information in this guide should apply across an on-premise environment and many cloud providers. But we include specific recommendations for Azure as one of the most common deployment targets.

The target audience for the document is architects, developers, and operations personnel. To get the most value from this document, a reader should have a good knowledge of Docker,  kubernetes, and API management.

## General architecture

This chapter is focused on general architecture in support of an API management deployment on a dedicated Kubernetes cluster. The chapter discusses architectural principles, as well as required and optional components. There are many ways to deploy software on a Kubernetes cluster, but this document shares Axway's experience acquired from deploying AMPLIFY API Management in an actual production environment. Most of the implementation details will be outlined in the following chapters.

Make sure the constraints listed in the chapters are respected in case of deployment on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

### Principles

The name of the new deployment option _EMT_ gives a good clue that with this option, many operational aspects of the architecture are externalized to an orchestration component. Existing users of AMPLIFY API Management should be aware that with EMT deployment, the role of Admin Node Manager becomes more of a monitoring tool and Node Manager is completely removed from the EMT architecture.

Official testing is taking place in Kubernetes as the orchestration component. However, the Docker images are agnostic, so they can be deployed in other orchestration platforms, like Swarm. Kubernetes manages many important aspects of runtime, security, and operations, for example:

* Autoscaling API Gateway with CPU or memory consumption threshold.
* Self-healing.
* Rolling updates with zero downtime.

In generic terms, reference architecture can be built by stacking four layers of different capabilities:

![Reference architecture layers](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image1.png)  

The packaging of API Management for deployment has changed in the EMT mode. Customers need to build a new Docker image for any new `FED` or `POL` file that they want to deploy. For more information,  see [Deploy API Gateway in containers](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/). We recommend creating a DevOps pipeline that can be triggered anytime a new configuration is ready for deployment.

To manage Docker images, customers need to set up a Docker registry as a repository for created images. To help customers with setting up a required environment, the following table describes the required and recommended options.

|Description|Required?|
|---|---|
|A DevOps pipeline is strongly recommended for building Docker images| Recommended|
|A storage system with enough capacity to store dedicated data and to share data between components| Required|
|A bastion for administration tasks on API management and Kubernetes|Required|
|A container registry to store Docker images | Required|

Besides [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), we use [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts to describe the entire deployment configuration. Using Helm provides an efficient way to package all configuration parameters for Kubernetes and API Management containers to be deployed with a single
command.

### Target use case

We review a single deployment option where all API Management components are running inside a single Kubernetes cluster. This pattern allows one to virtualize back-end apps or APIs hosted inside or outside the cluster. It is possible to deploy multiple API gateway groups in the same cluster. But keep in mind that every API gateway group configuration should be deployed as a separate Docker image.

In our scenario, we expose several entry points for the external clients inside the cluster (see implementation details in the next chapter). All API Gateways write their transaction events to a shared volume. Admin Node Manager streams those events to a relational database management system. API Gateway Manager UI can be used to view the traffic monitor
and events data.

A dedicated deployment environment requires:

* Kubernetes cluster.
* Docker registry.
* Cassandra cluster.
* RDBMS.
* Storage system for shared volume.
* Monitoring system.
* Bastion system for cluster access.
* DevOps pipelines to control Docker image build and deployment to a target environment.

The following diagram shows a general architecture of a single cluster configuration:

![Single cluster configuration](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image2.jpg)

### Additional components and considerations

In this section, we present considerations for using additional components in the single cluster architecture.

#### Container registry

This registry is used to store Docker images and Helm packages. You may consider maintaining at least two pipelines: one for building images and the other for deploying them to a target environment. The image building pipeline would build and push images to the registry. The deployment pipeline would deploy a specific Helm package. In this scenario, Docker images are pulled by Kubernetes and deployed to a cluster. One of the requirements in this environment is to securely pass container registry credentials during Helm package deployment. We suggest using Kubernetes secrets. Besides registry access credentials, you will need to maintain additional sensitive data that is described in the following table.

|Description|Required?|
|---|---|
|Docker images contain such sensitive data as license key, certificate, and configuration. This data must be protected.| Required|
|The password is sensitive and must be encrypted in the system.| Required|
|Operations should define a clear tag strategy for Docker images tagging. | Recommended|

#### Bastion host

Administrative tasks should be executed safely. We use a bastion host to bridge to the following instances via the internet:

* Kubernetes master nodes for managing a cluster.
* Kubernetes Dashboard.
* RDBMS and Cassandra.
* Debugging any issue with a Kubernetes cluster.

The bastion must have high traceability with specific RBAC permissions to allow a few selected users to access infrastructure components.

#### DevOps pipeline

A DevOps pipeline is based on a suite of tools to build and push gateway configuration and APIs to a target deployment environment and run a set of verification tests. Since a Docker container is immutable, any change in API gateway configuration requires building a new Docker image.

Axway provides several CLI tools that fit nicely into a DevOps pipeline. Later in the document, we will describe them:

* Docker build scripts.
* API promotion tool (`apimanager-promote`).
* GitHub projects.

#### SMTP relay

The API Manager component can send alerts and messages. By default, the solution only supports SMTP(S) to send an email. But customization can be done in alerts policies to send an email by API.

### Performance goals

An important factor for achieving your goals with the EMT deployment is to define a set of performance goals. These will be unique for a specific set of APIs, deployment platform, and clients' expectations. Later in the document, we show an example of the performance metrics that have been achieved in testing a reference architecture by the Axway team.

## Implementation details

This chapter details the configuration for each component.

### Diagram

In this section, we show the main diagrams that represent Axway API Management architecture deployed on Azure.

#### Technical view

The architecture is designed with High Availability (HA) in mind. An HA deployment requires redundancy and high throughput for all infrastructure components and networks. To reach this target, the architecture uses most of Azure PaaS with an appropriate plan and multiple availability zones for VMs. The components must be deployed in multiple zones. In our configuration, we use three availability zones. This configuration is compliant with a minimal technical SLA of 99.99 percent. Each component will be described in the next chapters.

![Technical view](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image3.jpg)

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
For a standard architecture, you must replace Availability Zone by _availability set_ configuration to isolate VM resources from each other. Axway recommends setting three update domains and three fault domains. The bigger impact is on the Helm chart with affinity node configuration.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Application view

The following diagram represents the main objects inside Kubernetes with main configurations. High availability is also present in the pod specification.

![Application view](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image4.png)

### Choice of runtime infrastructure components

This section provides recommendations for a typical implementation of the runtime infrastructure components. In this configuration, all assets of the Kubernetes cluster are deployed in the same data center or a region (in case of a cloud deployment), although components are spread out in various racks, rooms, or availability zones.

The following table lists the number of runtime components in this configuration.

|Assets |Spec|
|--- |---|
|Worker nodes                                    |3 to 6|
|Cassandra nodes                                    |3|
|Azure Database for Mysql                           |1|
|Blob storage                                   |70GB|
|Azure file storage                             |20GB|
|External IP (public or private)                 |1 min|
|Azure Load Balancer or Azure Application Gateway   |1|
|Azure AD                                           |1|
|Azure container registry                           |1|
|Bastion                                            |1|
|Worker pipeline                                    |1|

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
These values are the minimum recommended starting point. Your actual values will depend on many factors, like the number of APIs, payload size, and so on.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Network specification

This typical network deployment is based on a minimal number of segregated zones. It consists of three subnets in one Virtual Network for a dedicated VNET:

![Network specification](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image5.JPG)

* **Bastion Subnet** where administration tasks will be done. The recommended network mask is `/28`.
* **AKS Subnet** for Kubernetes worker nodes. The recommended network mask is `/23`.
* **Data Subnet** to host Cassandra Databases. The recommended network mask is `/27`.

Each subnet must be protected by a firewall lvl4 called Network Security Group (NSG) with appropriate inbound and outbound rules (see tables below).

Restrict access from the subnet to only required Azure service, like Azure Container Registry (need a premium SKU) and Azure Database for Mysql.

The diagram shows just one availability zone.

{{% alert title="Note" color="" %}}
Firewalls and Virtual networks capabilities for Azure Container Registry are in preview and a Premium SKU is required, although Axway recommend using a Standard plan.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) sizes

![AKS](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image6.png)

AKS is a platform as a Service managed by Microsoft. Customers cannot access the Kubernetes master component. They must use a client like Azure CLI or Azure Portal to configure the
control plane. Using AKS, customers have the advantage of creating a secured and scalable cluster in less than 5 minutes, and Master nodes are free and only worker node costs money.

Although it is not possible to provide multiple subnets inside AKS, customers can define different _node pools_ to set a different kind of VM. For Axway API Management, we define 2 node pools:

* `apimpool` for all AMPLIFY Components (API Gateway, API Manager, ANM). This pool must be in autoscaling mode. Node autoscaler creates a new VM when the control plane receives an alert that pod cannot be scheduled on any existing node. Once the workload goes down, and CPU utilization drops below 50% for more than 10 min, this new node will be deleted. It is possible to change the default values. See [What are the parameters to CA?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-the-parameters-to-ca) Axway recommends using a VM compliant with premium storage. By default, Axway recommends a Standard_DS3_v2 to support API Gateway upgrade with 3 replicas (default configuration in Helm chart).
* `infrapool` for other auxiliary components like monitoring tools, backup, and other tools (maintenance). Axway recommends a Standard_D2_v3 but makes sure that it is enough to support
additional tools.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Node pool names are important because they will be used to make affinity and anti-affinity configuration between both pods and nodes. They are defined in Helm chart value.
{{% /alert %}}

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Node Autoscaler is triggered when a pod fails to be scheduled. Add node scheduling logic to create a new worker node before a cluster exhausts its capacity | Recommended|

#### Cassandra cluster size

Cassandra is a distributed database, so each node requires its own storage. For production, Axway recommends a standard Cassandra cluster on three nodes. Axway also recommends a VM with large bandwidth and a capacity to use premium SSD storage, like Standard_D4s_v3. See [Dv3 and Dsv3-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json) for more descriptions. Three Cassandra VMs must be spread on three availability zones.

A volume of 50GB must be allocated on each Cassandra node. Axway recommends using P6 disks according to disk capacity. But in some cases, Axway and Microsoft recommend using P30 disks for a higher flow rate. See [Managed disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/managed-disks/) for more information about managed disks.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Use of Cosmos DB                                 |Not recommended|
|Cassandra nodes spread on 3 availability zones   |Recommended|

#### Azure Database for Mysql

Azure Database for Mysql is a DBaaS managed by Microsoft. ANM uses an RDBMS to store data. RDBMS uses less storage than Cassandra, so 20GB for a simple instance is acceptable.

Axway recommends using Azure Database for Mysql with four vCores in general Purpose mode and the last generation of CPU. Minimal storage in this plan is 50 GB with 150 IOPS. See [Azure Database for MySQL pricing tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-pricing-tiers) for a complete description of the vCore and pricing tier.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Use a standard plan with 50GB (for bandwidth)   |Recommended|
|Activate TLS configuration                      |Recommended|
|Use Endpoint termination                        |Recommended|

#### Azure Files Premium (AFP) for shared storage

##### Events logs

API gateways generate events. A shared volume is required. The volume is limited by a setting inside the deployment package (FED file). By default, this value is set to 1GB. Three gateways are deployed in the minimal configuration. But autoscaling can increase this number to 12 replicas (or more in your custom configuration), as an example. So, storage of 13 GB must be configured.

Follow this method to estimate disk space:

![Server Settings - Transaction Event Log](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image8.png)

```
Max_disk_space x API_gateway_max_replica + 1GB = recommended_disk_space
```

It is important to select a proper disk option for logs in your target environment (cloud or on-premises). In the Kubernetes environment, there may be many pods simultaneously writing to shared storage. Selected disks must support this target workload.

Azure Files is the perfect answer to shared files between pods. It requires a Storage account. The minimal size is 100Gib. See the Security considerations section for access restriction.

#### Azure Blob Storage for logs

A volume is required to store all logs streamed out from a Kubernetes cluster. Axway recommends using a premium SSD storage except if you want geo-replication for data persistence. In this case, Axway recommends a Local Replication Storage (LRS) or a Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS). The data will contain:

* Kubernetes logs
* Containers logs
* Applications logs

FluentD_ has been used in our environment to stream logs. A plugin is available to stream logs to blob storage. In this case, Blob storage has a dynamic sizing with high limitation. See [Logging and tracing](#logging-and-tracing) for more details.

#### Azure App Gateway or Azure Load Balancer

A load balancer is required in front of the cluster. We use the Kubernetes object called _ingress controller_ that is responsible for fulfilling the ingress rules. A layer 7 load balancer is configured in this architecture. It performs important tasks of terminating TLS connection and request routing. Two solutions are possible with this architecture.

##### Azure Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway has a mode for the Ingress controller (AGIC). It is fully managed by Azure and configuration is the easiest for the solution. You do not have to manage AGIC pods, just configuration inside the cluster. For example, http2 is deactivated on the Azure component and not directly in the pod. Axway recommends using a Standard V2 Tier without autoscaling. HTTP2 must be disabled. But AGIC usage is more expensive because outbound flows are billed at approximately $500 for 9TB.

![Azure Application Gateway](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image10.JPG)

##### Azure Load Balancer

Azure Load Balancer is a traditional load balancer. An ingress component is based on Nginx. In this case, the configuration is a little more complex and centralized inside the cluster. It has a more flexible configuration. For example, you can configure the name of a cookie for persistent sessions.

This solution does not carry any additional cost.

![Azure Load Balancer](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image11.JPG)

Azure Application Gateway uses Kubernetes services only for endpoint discovery. Then it routes requests directly to the IP endpoint. So, latency is smaller. But Azure Application Gateway has some limitation to manage certificates. First, it does not allow certificates signed by private authority. Secondly, a certificate must be composed by appending a top-level and second-level domains: `domainname.tld`.

API Gateway Manager uses a certificate for internal communication between components (API Gateway, API Manager) and also for its User Interface by default. This certificate cannot use a certificate like `domainname.tld`. For this reason, this certificate cannot be used with Azure Application Gateway. The simplest way is to provide the second listener (see section Admin Node Manager for detailed description).

#### Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry is deployed to store both Helm chart and docker images. Helm chart is a very small package, but 1GB is required to store main APIM images (ANM, APIMGR, BASE). Customers need to build a new docker image for every policy or configuration change in the `FED` file. Customers should have an image governance approach to maintain the required images in the registry. For example, if you need to roll back the current image (configuration) to one of the previous versions, that previous version must exist in the container registry.

A Standard SKU is enough for space and performance, but Axway recommends an SKU Premium to restrict access to specific networks such as the AKS subnet and DevOps worker if needed.

### Kubernetes considerations

This section focuses on additional Kubernetes objects and configuration inside the cluster to support Axway components. This is a required step before deploying containers. A [sample Helm chart](https://github.com/Axway/apigw-helm-charts) is available. Use it as a starting point for building your Helm chart.

#### Deployment options

There are parameters that you specify at the time of the creation of a Kubernetes cluster. One of them is a network manager for communication between pods. The second one is a set of strong permissions for Kubernetes.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Network CNI mode with a specific plugin (CALICO or Cloud provider) to secure pod connections with other applications or resources inside the cluster  | Recommended|
| Secure Kubernetes with RBAC capabilities  |  Recommended|

##### Network plugin

By default, there is no isolation between pods inside the cluster in Kubernetes. It is not a problem to deploy it on a dedicated cluster; default Kubernetes networking will be enough. API management capabilities do not require specific rules. But in some cases, API management may be deployed with other back end or apps in the same cluster. In this case, it is necessary to use a Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin. In the case of Azure, Axway recommends plugin _Azure CNI_. This plugin avoids a NAT between network and pods for low latency compared to Kubelet, but each pod will consume an IP in AKS Subnet. This is the reason why we use a large address range on this subnet.

Also, it is possible to apply 3 kinds of network policies with CALICO or
Azure Policy Manager (see [Integrating Azure CNI and Calico: A technical deep dive](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/integrating-azure-cni-and-calico-a-technical-deep-dive/)):

* Drop communication by default
* Allow connection to API gateway from specific namespaces
* Allow connection to pods from specific monitoring tools

##### RBAC Permission

RBAC permission is a secure mechanism to manage authorization inside Kubernetes. It's recommended to set people or application permissions to manage resources:

* Allow Helm to manage resources.
* Allow worker nodes autoscaling.
* Allow specific users to view pods, to deploy pods, to access Kubernetes Dashboard.
* Allow cert-manager to pull and encrypt certificate.
* Allow Kubernetes to provide cloud resources, like storage or load balancer.

This is a minimal configuration and you can define more specific permissions with cluster roles and binding in the cluster.

Also, a Service Principal on Azure is required. Here are the main permissions:

* Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role.
* AcrPull on all container registries where docker images and Helm charts are stored.
* Network Contributor on the vnet.
* Read/Write access to a storage account.
* Managed Identity Operator and contributor for managed identity AAD_POD_IDENTITY.

Axway recommends 2 services principals:

* The first one is to build and configure all services.
* The second one is to run a solution in production.

#### Namespaces

A namespace allows splitting of a Kubernetes cluster into separated virtual zones. It's possible to configure multiple namespaces that will be logically isolated from each other. Pods from different namespaces can communicate with a full DNS pattern `<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local`. A name is unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

As mentioned in [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/), a typical usage of namespaces is separating projects and configured objects deployed by different teams.

Axway recommends deploying all API management components inside the same namespace:

* According to Kubernetes best-practice, the deployment is the responsibility of API team.
* It is easiest to deploy the solution inside an existing cluster.
* You do not have to specify full DNS to call other components, therefore, preventing errors. You just use a service name (`<service-name>`).

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Provide all API management assets in the same namespace | Recommended|

#### Pod resource limits

Axway API Gateway runs in a Java VM. A Java VM pool is limited with the `Xmx` parameter: If there is a memory leak, it can affect the entire cluster. JVM heap size should be limited.

Kubernetes permits defining a CPU and memory limits for each pod to protect the cluster. Setting up the limits is especially important in case a cluster is shared with other apps. When scheduling a pod deployment, Kubernetes uses these limits to ensure that resources for a pod are available on a target node.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Limit memory and CPU usage to protect the cluster                                  |Recommended|
|Change Xmx value and resources limitations according to the size of worker nodes   |Recommended|

These are the recommended initial limits for AMPLIFY API Management components:

* API Manager pod: 2cpu with 2GB memory and initial request of 0,5cpu with 0,5GB memory
* Admin Node Manager: memory resource limit of 2GB memory

#### Components healthcheck

Kubernetes provides a very useful feature called probes. There is one probe to check if a pod is ready to be used at startup and another one to periodically check if a container is still operational. These probes are respectively called _readiness probe_ and _liveness probe_.

These probes are configured on all ports (traffic and UI) and use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Implement Kubernetes probes to manage container status in real-time   |Required|

#### Affinity and anti-affinity mode

##### Affinity node

As explained in the last chapter, 2 node pools are created in AKS: one for APIM and another for tools. It's necessary to make an affinity mode to avoid a pod to be created in the wrong pool. By default, in AKS each VM has annotation with the name of node pool where it is configured. All node pools in AKS have the `agentpool` annotation by default.

```
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: agentpool
                operator: In
                values:
                - apimpool
```

##### Anti-affinity pods

Kubernetes pod allocation strategy is based on the nodes' resources availability. Potentially, more than one pod replica can be deployed on the same node. For an HA deployment, you want to spread your runtime components across multiple nodes and availability zones. For this reason, we recommend using a Kubernetes option called _podAntiAffinity_. You should instruct Kubernetes _not_ to schedule the same replicas on the same node if it is possible based on the resource availability.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Dispatch APIM pods across available nodes (monitoring node can be excluded from this rule)   |Required|

```
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 100
            podAffinityTerm:
              labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                  - key: app
                    operator: In
                    values:
                    - traffic
```

#### Autoscaling

To properly increase or decrease the number of runtime components to accommodate a workload, there are two scaling techniques used in the reference architecture:

* Nodes/VMs autoscaling
* Kubernetes pod autoscaling

##### Node scaling

AKS can create new nodes (in different pools) when a pod can't be scheduled because of insufficient resources (CPU or RAM). For example, when you perform a rolling update of an API gateway, Kubernetes create pods from the new docker image before deleting the old ones. For example, if you run 6 replicas with a maximum of 2CPU per pod, Kubernetes will need 6 more CPUs to create a new deployment during a short time. This means that Kubernetes will create 2 new nodes (if using the recommended VM size) in *akspool* during the deployment. Kubernetes will delete them after 5 minutes of low activity (under 50% average usage).

If the allocated number of nodes/VMs is not enough for increasing traffic, and your API solution may experience an abrupt increase of API calls, Axway recommends using a platform-provided mechanism to scale nodes. For Azure, it should be an Azure Automation script based on a target resource consumption, for example, CPU.

##### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) you can automatically scale the number of API Gateway components. HPA uses a control loop that checks selected utilization metrics every 15s (default value). There are several options for triggering autoscaling. The average CPU utilization can be used. It is set to a high enough value for optimal resource usages. When CPU utilization exceeds this threshold, Kubernetes adds more pods. You need to test what should be a good CPU utilization based on your pod start-up time, traffic pattern, and potential impact on the overall performance. An average CPU utilization of 75 percent is a good starting point. Keep in mind that to get HPA working, you need to define resource limits (notice, that our CPU limit is 2cpu). This is an example of this setting in Helm:

```
metrics:
- type: Resource
  resource:
    name: cpu
    target:
      type: Utilization
      averageUtilization: 75
```

#### External traffic

We use the ingress controller to expose API management apps and services to external clients. It dynamically creates externally reachable URLs for desirable endpoints, load balance traffic between pods, and terminate TLS connections. This mode is available only for HTTP and HTTPS.

|Description | Type |
|---|---|
|Terminate TLS before a request reaches pods                                               |Required|
|Need specific DNS entry to route requests (solution with rewrite path isn't functional)   |Required|

A specific DNS entry is required to route requests to a service inside a Kubernetes cluster. These are the exposed interfaces in our configuration:

* `anm.FQDN` for API Gateway Manager UI.
* `api-manager.FQDN` for API Manager UI.
* `api.FQDN` for API traffic.

DNS records must match the certificate and ingress host configuration. These records must target the external IP used for the Kubernetes entry point.

{{% alert title="Note" color="" %}}
It is not possible to use some rewrite-path like `https://FQDN/Components/` to access the web interface.
{{% /alert %}}

It is necessary to configure the following annotations for ingress configuration:

* Disable HTTP/2 if your ingress chooses it by default.
* Authorized entry port (recommended to allow only HTTPS).
* An HTTPS redirection if HTTPS is authorized with the previous rules.
* Force usage of TLS protocol v1.2.
* Specify HTTPS protocol for a back end.
* Localization of each certificate.
* A range IP authorization (optional, but recommended only for private access).

Kubernetes lists available [ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) and you can pick any Ingress controller option that fits your
requirements.

Here are the two options:

**Azure Application Gateway**:

```
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway
appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: https
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
cert-manager.io/acme-challenge-type: http01
appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/connection-draining: "true"
appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/connection-draining-timeout: "30"
```  

**Nginx**:

```
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
cert-manager.io/acme-challenge-type: http01
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity-mode: persistent
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "API-Gateway-Manager-UI"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: "172800"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: "172800"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-change-on-failure: "true"
```

Session cookie must be configured only for User Interface (API Gateway Manager, API Manager).

#### Secrets

Without secrets, all passwords are set in clear in manifests. Kubernetes define _secret_ objects to encode in base64 all sensitive information. Using secrets is very useful for variables in containers, Docker registry login, and technical token for shared storage.

Here is a table to list all the secrets used by pods:

| |Admin Node Manager   |API Gateway Manager   |API Gateway Traffic  | Ingress controller|
|----------------------- |----|----|----|----|
|Public certificate      | | | |X (one for each ingress)|
|Docker registry login   |X|X|X| |
|Cassandra user ID       | |X|X| |
|Shared storage ID       |X|X|X| |
|SGBDR user ID           |X| | | |

Another solution to store sensitives information is to replace Kubernetes secret by Azure Vault.

### API Management implementation details

This chapter describes API management components in Kubernetes.

#### Admin Node Manager

Admin Node Manager provides the API Gateway Manager web interface with monitoring capabilities. This component requires an RDBMS to store analytical data. It is accessed through an ingress controller. We recommend that ANM is available from an internal and secure location (for example, through bastion node).

To build an ANM container, you need to provide the following:

* HTTPS certificate. This certificate will be used inside the cluster, so it's possible to use a self-signed certificate. However, we recommend reviewing the usage of self-signed certs with your security team.
* A license file with the EMT mode. Notice that it is not required to start Admin Node Manager but may be required for optional features such as FIPS mode.
* JDBC library for the selected RDBMS.
* RDBMS connection parameters.

A FED for Admin Node Manager must be provided with the following configuration:

* Second Listener on 8091.
* A certificate signed with public authority and the secret key on this new listener.
* Environment variables in Default Database Connection:
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_URL}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_USERNAME}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_PASS}`

To deploy you need to provide:

* Heap size memory as mentioned before (set the value at 1024)
* Persistent storage with read/write multiple pods capabilities to store events
* RDBMS parameters
* Log format in JSON
* Trace level setting

The Helm chart contains a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before this pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running RDBMS server

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe.
* Kubernetes object: deployment.
* Resources limit: 1cpu & 2GB memory.
* Java heap size: 1024 MB.
* Automatic scalability: no.
* Replicas: 1.

#### API Manager UI

This pod supports an API Manager web interface (port 8075).

{{% alert title="Note" color="" %}}
As of Axway [API Management v7.7](/docs/apim_relnotes/201904_release/apig_relnotes/), we recommend running only one API Manager UI pod. This pod is not used to process client requests, so using one pod is enough. It also simplifies architecture. {{% /alert %}}

To build an API Manager container, you need to provide:

* HTTPS certificate. This certificate will be used inside the cluster. You can use a self-signed certificate. However, we recommend reviewing the usage of self-signed certs with your security team.
* A license file with the EMT mode set.
* A group name. It's mandatory because Admin Node Manager needs it to manage gateway.
* JDBC library for the selected RDBMS.
* A `FED` file with server settings and policies. It is also possible to use policy and environment package files. So, you can have one common policy package and several environment packages: one for each deployment environment.

To deploy you need to provide:

* Cassandra hosts and Keyspace name.
* Heap size memory as mentioned before (set the value at 1024).
* ANM hostname.
* RDBMS parameters.
* Log format in JSON.

A `FED` for API Gateway must be provided with following configuration:

* Certificate signed with a public authority and a secret key on API Portal's port
* Add path `/healthcheck` on API Portal ports
* Create new Database connection environment variables in Default
Database Connection:
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_URL}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_USERNAME}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_PASS}`
* Environment variables for Cassandra settings:
    * `${environment.CASS_HOST}`
    * `${environment.CASS_PORT}`
    * `${environment.CASS_USERNAME}`
    * `${environment.CASS_PASS}`
    * `${environment.CASS_KEYSPACE}`
    * `${environment.CASS_TKEYSPACE}`
* Enable SSL and add a client certificate in Cassandra Security.

The Helm chart contains a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before an API Gateway pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running three Cassandra hosts.
* Up and running RDBMS server.
* Up and running ANM pod.

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe
* Kind: deployment
* Exposed port UI 8075 (customers may configure a different port if needed)
* Resources limits: 2cpu & 2GB memory
* Java heap size: 1024 MB
* Session affinity: by cookie
* Replicas: 1

API Manager UI pod can send an email via SMTP relay. It's configured inside a `FED` file.

#### API Gateway/Manager (traffic)

API Gateway/Manager pod handles API calls. At the least, a traffic port (port 8065) should be exposed to this container. But if needed, additional ports can be exposed (secure and insecure ports 8443, 8080 and 8081). This component uses a volume mount point with read/write multiple pods capabilities to store events. Other data to persist is streamed out by FluentD. With this approach, you can reduce the size of persistence data required for log/event data.

The API Gateway/Manager docker image is the same as the API Manager UI image (one image per API Gateway group configuration).

API Gateway configuration can be split into multiple groups. Each group may support a different set of configuration parameters and policies (for example, per a business unit):

* A group is specified as a parameter during a Docker image generation.
* Each group needs a separate Keyspace.
* A group API Gateway and API Manager images must have the same `FED` configuration.

As you deploy an API Gateway group configuration, the API Gateway/Manager and API Manager UI containers are created from the same group image. The deployment parameters are the same. The only differences are in the Helm chart configuration. These are primarily the number of replicas and exposed ports.

You have two patterns in terms of a group deployment:

1. Configure all APIs in one group
2. Split APIs into multiple groups. With this pattern you will need to:
    * Generate multiple docker images: one per group
    * For each group, create required Cassandra Keyspaces (general,     throttling)

API Gateway Manager UI shows the complete topology: multiple groups, each with corresponding gateways.

The Helm chart contains a precheck mechanism (`initContainers`) to check for required preconditions before this pod can be started. Those checked preconditions are:

* Up and running three Cassandra hosts.
* Up and running RDBMS server.
* Up and running ANM pod.
* UP and running API Manager UI pod.

A `FED` for API Gateway must be provided with following configuration:

* Certificate signed with a public authority and a secret key on API Manager's port
* Add path `/healthcheck` on API Manager ports
* Create new Database connection environment variables in Default Database Connection:
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_URL}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_USERNAME}`
    * `${environment.METRICS_DB_PASS}`
* Environment variables for Cassandra settings:
    * `${environment.CASS_HOST}`
    * `${environment.CASS_PORT}`
    * `${environment.CASS_USERNAME}`
    * `${environment.CASS_PASS}`
    * `${environment.CASS_KEYSPACE}`
    * `${environment.CASS_TKEYSPACE}`
* Enable SSL and add the client certificate in Cassandra Security.

Pod characteristics:

* Healthcheck: LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe.
* Kind: deployment.
* Exposed traffic port 8065 (customers may configure a different port if needed).
* Resources limits: 2cpu & 2GB memory.
* Java heap size: 1512 MB.
* Automatic scalability: yes.
* Replica number: minimum/initial value is 3.

### Cassandra considerations

Cassandra must be hosted outside of the cluster. Minimum three nodes are required: one node in each availability zone. See [Administer Apache Cassandra](/docs/cass_admin/).

Cassandra must be in version 2.2.12.

Communication and access to the database must be protected:

* Use login and password.
* Configure Mutual authentication with a valid certificate in Cassandra Security options.
* Deactivate SSLv3 and TLSv1 protocols.

For a single region configuration, initial replication must be set as follows:

* Keyspace must have an Initial replication to 3 with a simple strategy.
* Throttling configuration must be configured with an initial replication to 3 with a simple strategy. Read and write consistency level at QUORUM.

A JMX exporter must be configured on each Cassandra node to monitor Cassandra. The listener is configured with the default port of 7070.

### Security considerations

The following is a summary of security considerations discussed within this document:

* In layered infrastructure, the network is protected by firewall LVL4 that filters only specifics ports. Any administrative access to infrastructure components is enabled through a subnet called a bastion. PaaS services have selected access from AKS or data subnet.
* All components are deployed in a cluster mode. Kubernetes uses RBAC permission to set roles per user or group. CNI plugin protects communications inside the cluster. All external connections are protected by an ingress controller with a public certificate.
* In the application layer, sensitive data is protected inside a secret. All communications are encrypted in a cluster. API Management uses only TLS 1.2.
* Do not run containers in a privileged mode.
* Only allow communication on required ports.

Here additional information on security in AKS:

* It is possible to limit actions performed by a container or process with AppArmor or `seccomp`, but it is not enabled by default.
* Microsoft doesn't reboot nodes after patching them. It recommends Kured to reboot them one by one.
* See [Microsoft security recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security).
* Axway did not configure AppArmor or seccomp filters by default, but it strongly recommends deploying Kured.

### SQL database considerations

AMPLIFY API Management supports several RDBMS:

* MySQL or MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle database

For this guide, Axway did not test Azure SQL Database because the supported MySQL version is not available on Azure.

### Logging and tracing

The following logs should be persisted:

* Trace files.
* Admin Node Manager: `INSTALL_DIR/trace`.
* API Gateway instance: `INSTALL_DIR/groups/<group-id>/<instance-id>/trace`.
* Transaction audit log - see [Transaction audit log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-audit-log-settings).
* Transaction access log - see [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-access-log-settings).
* Transaction event log - see [Transaction event log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings/#transaction-event-log-settings)
* Open traffic event log - see [Open traffic event log settings](/docs/apim_reference/monitor_traffic_events_metrics/#open-traffic-event-log-settings)

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Fluentd is deployed on infrapool nodes in AKS to stream logs. Fluentd is deployed on each node using a Daemonset. Although Fluentd does not have an Azure blob connector, a plugin is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/fluent-plugin-azure-storage-append-blob). You can also [use Fluentd with Azure Log Analytics](https://github.com/yokawasa/fluent-plugin-azure-loganalytics).
{{% /alert %}}

### Monitoring

A system is required to monitor the platform and containers inside it.

Axway recommends using the Prometheus server with Grafana Web interface. These 2 components are deployed in the infrapool nodes in AKS. Prometheus is composed of 3 services:

* Server with a Web interface. This component needs a PVC to store data.
* PushGateway monitors Kubernetes ephemeral objects as Jobs. Kubernetes jobs are used to deploy APIM.
* AlertManager notifies your central monitoring system or sends Alert email. In this reference architecture, an only email alert is possible.

For more details and specific configuration, see [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

Microsoft Azure offers a complete system monitoring for all managed services (Azure Container Registry, Azure App Gateway, Azure Kubernetes Services, Virtual Machines). It's based on Azure monitor coupled with log analytics that collects all metrics and stores them in blob storage.

Also, for Azure Kubernetes Services, Microsoft has developed an extended feature of Azure monitor to collects containers stdout, stderr, and environmental variables.

See [Configure agent data collection for Azure Monitor for containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-agent-config#overview-of-configurable-prometheus-scraping-settings) for more information.

| Description | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Use one of the following solutions:  Azure monitor with container analytics and logs analytics or Prometheus with Grafana | Recommended |

### Environmentalization and promotion

Environmentalization and promotion go hand in hand. AMPLIFY API Management uses two different artifacts:

* **Polices** - used by API Gateway.
* **API data files** - used by API Manager.

![Promotion](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image13.png)

The section below covers how the polices are promoted from the development environment to the testing environment.

Policy promotion steps:

1. Policy developer edits configuration and deploys it in the development environment via Policy Studio.
2. Policy developer tests the policies in the development environment.
3. Policy developer enables the display of configuration settings that are assigned for environmentalization in Policy Studio: open **Window > Preferences > Environmentalization** in the main menu, and select **Allow environmentalization of fields**.
4. Policy developers environmentalize environment-specific settings. For example:
    * **URL**, **User Name**, and **Password** fields in a Default Database Connection.
    * The **URL** field in a Connect to URL filter.
    * **X.509 Certificate** field in an HTTPS interface.
    * **URL**, **User Name**, **Password**, and **Signing Key** fields for an LDAP configuration.
5. Policy developer checks in the code to Git.
6. CI pipeline checks out the code from git and uses [projpack](/docs/apigtw_devops/deploy_package_tools/) CLI to create a pol and env package. This can be done in the Policy
Studio. When the active configuration is loaded, select **File > Save > Policy Package** to save the pol file and **Select File > Save > Environment Package** to save the env file.
7. Policy Developer uses env package to create an environment-specific artifact (like `test.env` and `prod.env`).
8. Policy developer creates a Docker container using pol and env package. For more information, see [Create and start API Gateway Docker container](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_script_gwimage/) for more information.

    Example:

    ```
    ./build_gw_image.py --license=license.lic --default-cert --pol=banking.fed --env=test.env --merge-dir /home/axway/apigateway
    ```

9. Policy Developer pushes Docker image to your Docker registry.
10. Policy Developer deploys to test environment by pulling an environment-related tag from the Docker registry.

API Manager promotion:

* API as code. The [apim-cli GitHub project](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apim-cli) can be used to create and promote an API across environments.
* Promote API using export and import mechanism - See [Promote managed APIs between environments](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_promote/).
* Promote API using REST API. [Sample implementation](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apim-deployment).

### Performance testing

![Performance testing](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image14.png)

The Axway team ran a variety of performance tests on the reference architecture. These tests were executed with a testing tool JMeter. Axway recommends deploying the performance stack in the same VNET and the appropriate location. In our case, it has a technical separation between 2 platforms without additional costs of the outbound data transfer.

All connections are encrypted in TLS. Backend is hosted on 2 nodes on the AKS cluster. The API has multiple methods that correspond to the payload. It is protected by basic authentication.

## Maintenance

After you deploy AMPLIFY API Management in production, you will need to update product configurations (policies and settings) and install fixes and service packs. This section outlines best practices in maintaining your installation.

### New configurations

With a shift to a container-based deployment, the notion of pushing API Gateway/Manager configuration updates directly to the running instances has changed. Now you need to create a new Docker image that contains the latest Gateway/Manager configuration. Using [Kubernetes rolling upgrades](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/),
you deploy a new Docker image to a cluster without interrupting your request processing. To learn how to create and deploy a new Docker image, see [Development and deployment with API Gateway containers](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_development/).

In general, the process of building AMPLIFY API Management Docker images for installation can be depicted as in the picture below.

![Docker images](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image15.tmp)

Description of the images:

* A base image includes a base product installation and does not change frequently. You update a base image only when you need to install an update for the underlying operating system, or when you need to install a service pack for AMPLIFY API Management or upgrade the product.
* An ANM image represents Admin Node Manager, but in the container-based deployment, it is not used for pushing new configurations to the gateways. It is primarily a monitoring tool.
* Gateway or API Manager images contain configuration and settings (`*.pol` and `.evn`, or `*.fed`) that are updated frequently. These are the type of images that you would rebuild frequently.

Axway provides sample build scripts as a working example to be modified and used by customers. The sample scripts are provided from the Axway support site. For example, a download file for AMPLIFY API Management v7.7 is `APIGateway_7.7-1_DockerScripts.tar.gz`.

To streamline this process for building Docker images, Axway recommends creating a CI/CD pipeline that should, at least, include these tasks:

* Creating a policy package (`.pol`).
* Creating an environment package (`.env`) for every target deployment environment.
* Creating an environment-specific Docker image; for example, for a test, QA, or production.
* Deploying a new Docker image to a target environment and smoke testing.

Customers should use a source control management (SCM) system for maintaining/versioning policy and environment packages and a Docker registry for Docker images.

### Product updates

There are variations in how to install a new patch, service pack, or upgrade for a new AMPLIFY API Management version. But the overall approach is that:

* For an upgrade or SP installation, you rebuild your base, ANM and Gateway/Manager images.
* For a patch installation, you rebuild your ANM and Gateway/Manager images.

#### Installing a patch

Patch installation requires updating one or more files in the target product installation directory. To apply a patch, you need to overwrite one or more files when you build an ANM or Gateway/Manager images. The build scripts provide the `--merge-dir` option that allows you to overwrite any files in a Docker image. The example and additional explanation of the procedure can be found in [Apply a patch, update, or service pack](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_patch_sp/).

The following is an example of a build command for a Gateway/Manager image:

```
./build_gw_image.py
  --license=/tmp/api_gw.lic
  --domain-cert=certs/mydomain/mydomain-cert.pem
  --domain-key=certs/mydomain/mydomain-key.pem
  --domain-key-pass-file=/tmp/pass.txt
  --parent-image=my-base:latest
  --fed=my-group-fed.fed
  --fed-pass-file=/tmp/my-group-fedpass.txt
  --group-id=my-group
  --merge-dir=/tmp/apigateway
```

![Directories](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image16.png)

The `--merge-dir` points to a directory that contains the files that will replace specific installation files on a target Docker image. A merge directory must be named `apigateway`. For
example, if you need to update the `envSettings.props` file in a Gateway image, this is what you should have in your merge directory:

The `/tmp/apigateway` directory should mirror the file path in your target Docker image.

##### Step-by-step example

Let's look at applying one of the patches for APIM v7.7 - APIGateway 7.7-SP1 Patch17276:

1. Download a patch from the Axway Support website.
2. Create a merge directory:

    ```
    mkdir /tmp/apigateway
    ```

3. Extract downloaded file into the merge directory:

    ```
    tar -xvzf
    APIGateway_7.7-SP1_Patch17276_d16e79fb_allOS_BN20191024.tgz -C /tmp/apigateway/
    ```

4. The merge directory shows that two files will be written to a target Docker image during build:

    ![tree](/Images/apim-reference-architectures/container-azure/image17.png)

5. Run your build script specifying the merge directory that you've created:

    ```
    ./build_gw_image.py  
    --license=/tmp/api_gw.lic  
    --domain-cert=certs/mydomain/mydomain-cert.pem  
    --domain-key=certs/mydomain/mydomain-key.pem  
    --domain-key-pass-file=/tmp/pass.txt  
    --parent-image=my-base:latest  
    --fed=my-group-fed.fed --fed-pass-file=/tmp/my-group-fedpass.txt  
    --group-id=my-group  
    --merge-dir=/tmp/apigateway  
    --out-image=my-gtw:7.7-SP1-p17276
    ```

6. Two files from the patch will overwrite (or create) corresponding files in the new Docker image.

#### Installing a service pack

Installing a service pack is identical to creating your first API Gateway/Manager Docker image. The only difference is that you just need to download and use a combined installation file that includes base product plus a corresponding service pack. As an example, we look at AMPLIFY API Management v7.7 and API Management v7.7 with SP1 install files:

* API Management v7.7 install is titled: _API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 Install (linux-x86-64)_ with the following file: `APIGateway_7.7_Install_linux-x86-64_BN4.run`
* API Management v7.7 with SP1 install is titled: *API Gateway 7.7 Install Service Pack 1 (linux-x86-64)* with the following file: `APIGateway_7.7_SP1_linux-x86-64_BN201908271.run`

The build process will be identical to the one described in [new configurations](#new-configurations).

#### Upgrading the product

Upgrading your existing deployment to a new version of AMPLIFY API Management will be similar to a process described in [new configurations](#new-configurations). But there are some  additional steps to migrate your existing Gateway/Manager configuration using Policy Studio. [Upgrade a container deployment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/container_upgrade/) describes this process for API Management v7.7. The extra steps are needed to import your existing `.fed` file in Policy Studio. This will trigger an automatic update to your `FED` file. When done, export the updated `FED` (or `.pol` and `.env`) file and use it for building a new Docker image.

There may be additional upgrade steps related to other parts of your deployment (for example, Cassandra or RDBMS).

#### Adding customization

You may want to add or customize some files in the product installation directory. To do this with a container-based deployment, follow steps outlined in [Installing a patch](#installing-a-patch). The only difference is the need to create manually a proper directory structure of your merge directory.

### Pushing a new Docker image to your Kubernetes cluster

When there is time to push a new image to a Kubernetes cluster (in any environment), we rely on Kubernetes rolling updates that are supported under the Deployment object. This object has a section that governs the process of updating running containers with a new Docker image. This is an example of an update strategy specification:

```
strategy:  
  type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:  
      maxSurge: 1  
      maxUnavailable: 0
```

With the rolling update, Kubernetes will take down a designated number of pods, update them with a new image, and start. Then continue this process with other pods. The optional `maxUnavailable` parameter specifies that only one pod at a time can be updated. Instead of an absolute value for `maxUnavailable`, you can provide a percentage value that will represent a portion of your Deployment pods that can be updated at once. With four pods in Deployment set and `maxUnavailable: 25%` (the default value for `maxUnavailable` if it is omitted), Kubernetes will update one pod at a time.

There is another optional parameter - `maxSurge` (default value is 25 percent). For example, if there are four pods in your Deployment, then during a rolling update, the maximum number of pods with old and new configurations combined cannot be more than five:

```
4 pods (100%) + 1 pod (25% - maxSurge) = 5 pods (125%)
```

See the [Zero-downtime Deployment in Kubernetes with Jenkins](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/30/zero-downtime-deployment-kubernetes-jenkins/) article to learn more about rolling updates and other techniques for a zero downtime deployment.

## Configuration and data backups

It is essential for the smooth operation of an API management solution to perform regular backups of data and configurations. At a minimum, the following data, source code and artifacts should be included:

* Policies and server configuration - there are a couple of ways to maintain your deployment artifacts. You can maintain an API Gateway configuration as a Policy Studio folder in a source code management system (SCM). GitHub and GitLab are two popular choices. As an alternative, you can version control `FED` or `POL`/`ENV` files.

In addition to the source code, you need to maintain:

* Deployment artifacts in the form of a Docker image, since this is what you deploy in the EMT mode. Thus, a Docker registry is required.
* RDBMS backup - use the appropriate backup procedure for the selected RDBMS. Azure Database for Mysql has a native feature to save data and the transaction logs. By default, Azure schedules one full backup a week and 2 incremental backups per day. Axway recommends selecting geo-redundant backup storage.
* Cassandra - follow recommendations in [Cassandra backup and restore](/docs/cass_admin/cassandra_bur/). You will need to decide how frequently you should back up Cassandra. This decision will be impacted by what data you store in Cassandra. Is it only API Manager data? Or does it include OAuth tokens and custom KPS? The main discussion point is to decide how much data you
could potentially lose without seriously affecting your business. A daily backup may be a good starting point. There are a couple of good blogs on backing up and restoring Cassandra:
    * [Azure recovery service to backup VM with policy rules. Data retention is 2 weeks by default.](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-vm-at-scale)
    * [Medusa - Spotify's Apache Cassandra backup tool is now open source](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2019/11/05/cassandra-medusa-backup-tool-is-open-source.html)
* Log/trace/even files - Azure file premium is an Azure backup solution. Axway recommends a geo-redundant backup with a default history of 14 days.
* Helm charts and other environment-specific files should be part of an SCM with its own backup mechanism. You can use the Azure Container registry (geo-replication is enabled by default) to store Helm chart packages.

## Disaster recovery

For a disaster recovery procedure, you should have access to cloud resources in another region. Using backed-up configurations/data and Docker registry, you should be able to run a CI/CD pipeline for creating a new Kubernetes cluster in another region.

A complete deployment/restoration takes 1 hour.

## Known constraints and roadmap

As of AMPLIFY API Management v7.7, there are some differences or constraints compared to the classic mode deployment:

* API Portal and Embedded Analytics are not yet supported in the EMT mode. They should be deployed outside of a Kubernetes cluster.
* Distributed Ehcache is not supported. However, you can use Apache Cassandra as a distributed data store where CRUD operations are supported to directly interact with KPS, using scripts.
* Running with Embedded ActiveMQ configured in an instance is not advised. The recommendation is to use a JMS provider deployed outside of the API Management cluster.

The current version does not support all the configurations that currently exist for the classic deployment. Axway plans to address these limitations by delivering the following capabilities in the future:

* Broader support of current APIM configurations.
* Running API Portal in a Docker container.
* Native support of Embedded Analytics.
* Advancements in the current EMT mode.
* Mutable policy configuration - that enables a policy to be modified without the need to bake in a new Docker image.
* Reference architecture document for other cloud providers.
