**UCONF flags legend**

- EXPERT: Extra care must be taken; only advanced users should change this value.
- RECONFIG: Can be changed dynamically with a CFTUTIL RECONFIG type=UCONF, and a notification is displayed in the LOG.
- IRECONFIG: Can be changed dynamically with a CFTUTIL RECONFIG type=UCONF, but no notification is displayed in the LOG.
- RUNTIME MUTABLE READ_ONLY: Cannot be changed by a user.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Unsupported feature.
- OBSOLETE: No longer used.

> **Note**
>
> Note: By default, all UCONF parameters are static and require a restart. Only parameters with the RECONFIG or IRECONFIG flags are dynamic; for these dynamic parameters only you can use the reconfig command and no restart is required.
