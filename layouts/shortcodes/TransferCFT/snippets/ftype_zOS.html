| FTYPE  | FCODE  | Type of sent file  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B | BINARY  | Binary file (default) |
| T | EBCDIC  | Text file |
| J  | EBCDIC  | Stream text<br/> Using stream text (J) allows a text type file to be sent that contains records that exceed 32 KB. As opposed to text type (FTYPE=T), stream text does not add an EOL sequence (LF or CRLF) to the received file.<br/> When using stream text (FTYPE=J), the sender and the receiver must both have the FTYPE set to J. Setting only the sender or receiver to FTYPE=J results in unexpected content for the transferred file. |
