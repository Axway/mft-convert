Limit the number of failed login attempts
-----------------------------------------

Transfer CFT provides brute force protection for logging on the <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.TransferCFTName variable">Transfer CFT</span> UI, REST API, or Web Services when using either the *system* mode or *xfbadm* mode (UNIX and HP NonStop only) authentication. That is, it limits the number of login failure attempts, where both the user and the password are checked to avoid brute force attacks.

For other authentication methods, such as PassPort and LDAP, no check is made. You must manage that in the Password Policy of those external tools.

You can use the following UCONF parameters to manage this option:

- `copilot.general.login_failures_fname`: A file that stores data shared between Transfer CFT and Copilot.
- `copilot.general.max_login_failures`: An integer that sets the maximum number of login failures for a user (default is 3, and 0 disables this option).

> **Note**
>
> Note: In a multi-host environment, an attacker may have up to the copilot.general.max_login_failures \* &lt;number of host&gt; tries before the user is locked if the file is not in a directory shared by all hosts.

When the maximum number of login failures is reached, the user account is locked for 30 seconds.

****Platform specifics****

- On IBM i systems, there is no action if the password is incorrect as the system offers methods that you can rely on to avoid brute force attacks (the system value is [QMAXSIGN](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzarl/rzarlmaxsgn.htm)).
- On z/OS systems, only the inherent system protection is available (refer to the RACF suboperand [REVOKE](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.icha700/setrpw.htm) for the PASSWORD option).
- On OpenVMS systems, only existing system protection is available.
