The SWAITCAT command enables a client to wait until
a given transfer reaches a particular predefined phase, phasestep, or state before acting.

****Command syntax: <span style="font-weight: normal;">[SWAITCAT](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary)</span>****

****Task examples: [SWAITCAT tasks](../sync_transfer_request_tasks)****

Alternatively, you can use the parameters [WSTATES]() and [WTIMEOUT]() to replace SWAITCAT functionality.

Command features
----------------

The SWAITCAT command enables you to perform the following functions:

- Serialize transfers
- Remotely control
    transfers using synchronous communication
- Synchronize the
    termination of a collection of simultaneous transfers
- Enhance script
    functioning

SWAITCAT uses synchronous communication for notification when a predefined
phase, phasestep or state is reached. Or, conversely, it can notify CFTUTIL if the
phase, phasestep, or state
is not reached (K or H phasestep).

If the command fails, CFTUTIL sends the return code 8. The SWAITCAT
command specific errors are:

- SWAITCAT_FAILED:
    the transfer reached the K or H phasestep
- SWAITCAT_TIMEOUT:
    the defined timeout was reached
- SWAITCAT_NFOUND:
    no matching transfer was found
- SWAITCAT_DELETED:
    the transfer was deleted
- SWAITCAT_PARAM_ERROR: invalid parameter
- SWAITCAT_TOO_MANY:
    too many transfers were selected (more than 2)

### Parameters

- [SELECT](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/select)
- [STATES](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/states)
- [PHASES](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/phases)
- [PHASESTEPS](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/phasesteps)
- [TIMEOUT](../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/command_summary/parameter_intro/timeout)

### Select

Use this parameter allows you to filter on a particular transfer so that you can track its status depending on the other defined parameters. This is a
mandatory argument for which the value must be enclosed in double quotes.

```
SWAITCAT select="EXPRESSION"
```

******Expression******

<span class="code">`Select `</span>is a Boolean expression that identifies one transfer.

**Syntax**

See the value section for a list of possible values.

`CAT_ID OP VALUE`

`(CAT_ID OP VALUE)`

`CAT_ID OP VALUE && CAT_ID OP VALUE`

`CAT_ID OP VALUE ùùù_insert_pipe_here_ùù_insert_pipe_here_ùùù CAT_ID OP VALUE`

Possible values for CAT_ID, which filters on the current state:

- IDTU
- IDT
- PART
- PHASE (A, T, Y, Z, X)
- PHASESTEP (D, C, H, K, X)
- STATE   (D,C,T,X,H,K)
- DIRECT  (RECV,SEND)
- TYPE    (FILE,MESSAGE,REPLY)
- MODE    (REQUESTER,SERVER)
- IDF     
- IDA
- COMMENT

Possible values for OP:

- == equal
- != different
- ~= match pattern
    (value with \*,?)
- /= doesn't match
    pattern
- &gt;  greater
- &lt;  lower
- &gt;= greater or
    equal
- &lt;= lower  or
    equal

VALUE can be anything between double " or two single ' ' quotes.

### Phases

The Phases parameter is a string that can be composed of A, T, Y, Z, X and waits on the expected final phase.

- (A) Pre-processing: All pre-transfer script execution occurs here
- (T) Transferring: All transfer execution occurs in this phase
- (Y) Post-processing: All post-transfer script execution occurs here
- (Z) Acknowledgement: Acknowledgement reception/send steps and ack script execution occur here
- (X) Done: End condition when all of the previous phases are completed

### Phasesteps

The Phasesteps parameter is a string that can be composed of D, H, C, K, X, E and waits on the expected final phasestep.

- (D) At disposal: The processing of the Phase is ready to be executed; it is ready to go.
- (H) Hold: The processing of the Phase is on hold and waiting for an action to be executed.
- (C) Processing/Current: The Phase processing is being executed.
- (R) Retry: Retries renaming the file using the <span class="code">`FACTION retryrename `</span>value.
- (X) Done: This phase step only exists for the Done phase, once all previous phases are complete.
- (E) Exit EOT: This phase step only exists for the Post-processing phase, to signal an [end-of-transfer exit](../../managing_exits/about_the_end_of_transfer_type_exit).

### States

The states parameter is a string that can be composed of the T, X, Y, Z, N and A states, and filters on the expected final state. The default is "TX".

Possible values for the states parameter are:

- T: the transfer
    is completed
- TX: the transfer is completed or reached the X state
- A: the
    transfer is acknowledged
- TA: the transfer is completed and acknowledged
- TXA: the transfer is completed and acknowledged, or the transfer reached the X state and is acknowledged
- X: the transfer
    reached the X state
- XA: the transfer
    reached the X state and is acknowledged
- Y: the transfer completed the post-processing phase
- Z: the transfer completed the acknowledged phase
- N: the transfer completed and received a negative acknowledgment

### Timeout

Timeout is the maximum WAIT time in seconds. The default is approximately
one year (365\*24\*3600 s).

Example
-------

This example selects the first transfer that has the following IDTU.

```
SWAITCAT select='IDTU=="A00000A"'
```

The following example filters on transfers having the D state, but completes as soon as the first transfer reaches the TX state (even though there may be more transfers in the D state).

```
SWAITCAT select='state=="D"',states=TX
```

<span id="SWAITCAT ex 1"></span>The following example is a way to execute a batch processing task using SWAITCAT, which is a task that you cannot perform using the SEND command with WSTATES.
