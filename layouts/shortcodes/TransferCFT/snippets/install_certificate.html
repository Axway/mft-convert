The following tables describe the UCONF parameters that determine the certificates used by the Transfer CFT Copilot server to authenticate itself.

You can use the following certificate and private key formats, where the format of the certificate may differ from that of the key.

The certificate type is dictated by the file name extension (.p12, .pkcs12, .der, .pem, for example <span class="code">`my_certificate.pem`</span>).

*For native files in a z/OS or IBM i environment*, Transfer CFT first tries to decode the certificate in PEM format. If the format cannot be determined, the last letters of the file name are used as the suffix. IBM i also handles the certificates stored on the IFS partition.


| Supported format  | Type  | Extension  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Certificate  | PKCS#12  | p12, pfx, pkcs12  |
| Certificate  | PEM  | pem  |
| Certificate  | DER  | der  |
| Private key  | PEM  | pem  |
| Private key  | DER  | der  |
| Private key  | PKCS#8  | key, pem  |


****How to define a PKCS\#12 certificate****

This example uses a single PKCS\#12 certificate where you only require the file name and password.


| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| copilot.ssl.SslCertFile | conf/pki/&lt;my_certificate&gt;.p12 |
| copilot.ssl.SslCertPassword | Certificate password |
| copilot.ssl.SslKeyFile | Not used |
| copilot.ssl.SslKeyPassword | Not used |


****How to define a DER or PEM certificate****

This example uses a DER(or PEM) certificate with the private key in a separate DER file, where you define the key as well as the certificate.


| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| copilot.ssl.SslCertFile | conf/pki /&lt;my_certificate&gt;.der *or* .pem |
| copilot.ssl.SslCertPassword | Not used |
| copilot.ssl.SslKeyFile | conf/pki /&lt;my_key&gt;.der *or* .pem |
| copilot.ssl.SslKeyPassword | Key password, which is mandatory if the key file is encrypted PKCS#8 |
