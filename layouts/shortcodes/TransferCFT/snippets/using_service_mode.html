During installation you can elect to run most <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> products as a Windows service, which causes the server to start and stop with the computer. When running a product as a Windows service, the only visual clues of the server status outside of the user interface are the application log files and the Windows computer management window.

If you installed the products in Windows service mode, you can start and stop most products with Windows already running as follows:

1. From the desktop, select <span class="bold_in_para">****Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services****</span>.
1. Scroll down the Services list and right-click the product.
1. From the menu, select <span class="bold_in_para">****Start****</span>.
