| Parameter  | Default  | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cft.cftcat.auto_expand_percent  | 0  | This value indicates the factor increase, as a percentage, that the catalog will automatically expand.<br/> The value 0 disables the automatic expansion feature.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> Tip We recommend that you set this to a relatively high value, at least 50. When repeatedly expanded, the catalog's internal structure may become fragmented and, consequently, catalog access less efficient.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| cft.cftcat.auto_expand_max_size  | 1M  | The maximum number of records for the automatic catalog expansion option. |
