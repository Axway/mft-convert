### PI 07 Synchronization points option

This field indicates the interval between synchronization points and
the acknowledgement window. The values negotiated by Transfer CFT depend
on the type of access to the protocol connection (see PI22).

If a connection is required
with a mixed type of access, Transfer CFT negotiates the smallest
value of the **Data transferred between sync points**(S/RPACING) parameters of the of the protocol object (CFTPROT).

In server mode, Transfer CFT cannot increase the value proposed by the
requester partner. The **Acknowledgement window size** parameters negotiate in the same way as the synchronization
interval (S/RCHKW of the protocol object (CFTPROT)).
