Transfer CFT allows you to use a single key for a multi-node installation. To use a single key for multiple hosts, either:

- The hostname must not be defined for the key, or
- The hostname defined for the key matches the hostname of one of the hosts that composes the multi-node instance

Additionally, the key must have the cluster option.
