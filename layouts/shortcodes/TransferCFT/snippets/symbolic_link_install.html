If for whatever reason an installation that uses symbolic links fails, once the silent files have been corrected, you must delete the <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.TransferCFTName variable">Transfer CFT</span> home installation directory to which the symbolic link points. Failing to do so causes the installer to go into upgrade mode.
