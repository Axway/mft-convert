System requirements
-------------------

Transfer CFT on Windows requires the **Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2019** for proper functioning. This provides the necessary library files (DLL) for Transfer CFT. You must install `vcredist_x64.exe` prior to installing or upgrading Transfer CFT.

> **Note**
>
> Note: If the redistribution package is already installed on your Windows system, there is no need to reinstall.
