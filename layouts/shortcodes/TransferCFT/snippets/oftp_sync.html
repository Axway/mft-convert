To
specify the synchronization interval, set the SCREDIT and RCREDIT parameters.

These parameters correspond to the maximum number of network messages
(NSDU) consecutively sent by the requester before the server acknowledges
their reception. Once the maximum number of network messages has been
sent, the requester has to wait for permission from the server (reception
of a FPDU CDT = FPDU from CREDIT) before sending other data.

These parameters are negotiated with the partnerâ€™s symmetrical parameter
during the connection phase. After negotiation, the smallest value is
selected by Transfer CFT as the CREDIT window (=synchronization interval).

In all cases, the end of the transfer phase (characterized by the sending
of a FPDU EFID) sets the local value of the authorized CREDIT to zero
(which is equivalent to a data transfer inhibition). Authorization to
transfer data again is granted at the next application connection request
(sending of a FPDU SFID). This means that the sending of a FPDU SFID sets
the local CREDIT value to the CREDIT value negotiated during the connection
phase.
