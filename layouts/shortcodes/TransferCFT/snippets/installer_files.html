### Installer-generated files

During the installation, the Transfer CFT installer creates two files in the installation directory that are working files for the installer. Do not modify these files unless instructed to do so by Axway. While they are not used for Transfer CFTÂ operations, they are necessary for installer functions such as upgrades.

- .rundir
- .transfer_cft.properties
