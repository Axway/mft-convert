#### Parameters

The SPACING, RPACING, SCHKW and RCHKW parameters
are used to negotiate the use of the Synchronization function. This function
comprises the synchronization points
and acknowledgement anticipation window
items. The setting of synchronization points allows a transfer to be resumed,
following an incident, from a point other than the start of the file.
The resumption point is the last synchronization point acknowledged by
the file receiver.

The synchronization interval indicates
the maximum volume of data that the sender can send between two consecutive
synchronization points. Only the characters of the file to be transferred
are taken into account in this volume. If the file is compressed, the
interval between synchronization points must be calculated using the volume
of data obtained after compression.

The interval between synchronization points must be selected taking
the following factors into account:

- Exchange of synchronization
    points: a small interval penalizes performance
- Spacing of synchronization
    points: a large interval penalizes restarts
- Spacing of synchronization
    points assumes a large "buffering" capability, since this parameter
    is related to the acknowledgement anticipation
    window (see below) and consequently to the availability of memory
    resources
- Synchronization
    point can only be set between file articles, even if segmentation has
    taken place

This means that the negotiated value of the interval between synchronization
points must always be equal to or greater than the size of the largest
of the articles of the file to be transferred. If compression is used,
this then corresponds to the size of the largest article after compression.
The default value (36 kilo-bytes) has been chosen such that articles of
up to 32 kilo-bytes in size can be sent without problems, even though
this would only be necessary under exceptional circumstances.

A zero value of the interval between synchronization points indicates
that the Synchronization function is not to be used. Although this value
allows the transfer time to be decreased, the resumption point is the
start of the file.

The acknowledgement window determines
the number of synchronization points that the sender of the file can set
without waiting for an explicit response from the receiver partner for
each point. A zero value for the acknowledgement window indicates that
no synchronization point will be acknowledged.

#### In requester mode

When the SROUT
parameter of the CFTPROT command takes the value BOTH, the synchronization
interval negotiated by Transfer CFT, whether the transfer type is write (SEND command) or read (RECV command), is the smallest value of the SPACING
and RPACING parameters.

When the SROUT
parameter of the CFTPROT command takes the value SENDER (resp. RECEIVER),
the synchronization interval negotiated by Transfer CFT corresponds to
the SPACING (or RPACING respectively) parameter for a write
(or read) transfer type.

The value sent
may be reduced by the server partner. It is essential for the final value
negotiated to be greater than the maximum record size of the file. This
maximum size may also be increased by the compression function on the
basis of 1 byte every 32 bytes (for example: 32 bytes for a size of 1024,
128 bytes for a size of 4096).

#### In server mode

If the remote Transfer CFT
opens a one-way write (or read) session, Transfer CFT negotiates, as synchronization
interval, the smallest value between what the partner proposes and the
value of the RPACING parameter of the CFTPROT command for reception
(or the SPACING parameter for transmission).

For a two-way session,
Transfer CFT then negotiates the smallest value between the one proposed
by the partner and the values of the SPACING and RPACING
parameters.  

The acknowledgement window is negotiated in the same way as the synchronization
interval, using the SCHKW and RCHKW parameters of the CFTPROT
command.

The RESYNC parameter is used to negotiate the dynamic resynchronization
of exchanges option during transfer. The only dynamic resynchronization
case possible between two Transfer CFTs is in the event of a CRC
error (PAD = YES).

****Example****

`CFTPROT  ID = INTRAN,         ...         SCHKW   = 2,           SPACING = 4096,         ...`

The sender is able to send up to 4 Mbytes before each synchronization
point set. The sender can also send up to 8 Mbytes before waiting for
the last synchronization points to be acknowledged.
