Transfer CFT opens a secure session in client mode for any secure file
or message transfer in requester mode. Transfer CFT opens a secure session
in server mode for any incoming call requiring a secure protocol.

The properties of each SSL session opened by Transfer CFT in both client
and server modes are determined by a security profile.

A security profile monitors the:

- Required authentication
    mode: simple (server only) or mutual (server and client) authentication
- Authentication,
    encryption and sealing algorithms to be used
- Certificate to
    be sent for local authentication and the RSA authentication algorithm
- Checks to be performed
    on the remote certificate for remote authentication and the RSA authentication
    algorithm

The CFTSSL command describes a security
profile. The DIRECT parameter indicates the mode to which the security
profile applies: DIRECT=CLIENT for client mode or DIRECT=SERVER for server
mode.
