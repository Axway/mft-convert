Access tokens and SAML headers are signed using the key associated with the certificates referenced by `copilot.ssl.sslcertfile`. If this parameter is not set, but <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or FM is enabled, the governance certificate is used. If you change the certificate that is referenced in `copilot.ssl.sslcertfile` or you modify the   `cg.certificate.governance.key_len `value, the impact is that the corresponding private key changes. This means that once the new key is generated, access tokens and SAML exchanges with the SAML IDP no longer work.

You can see the [Change the private key length](../../../../governance_services_intro/cg_postregister#Change) section for details.
