This parameter defines the padding character at the file level.

- Fixed format: Specifies the character to use for padding using FPAD at file level. If FPAD is not set, the padding character depends on the FCODE used. When FCODE=ASCII it is an ASCII space, FCODE=EBCDIC it is an EBCDIC space, and FCODE=BINARY it is a binary zero.
- Variable format: Defines the character to use to unpad the record. If FPAD is not set, the record is unchanged.
