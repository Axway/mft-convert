Do not use the same name as you are using for the corresponding SCANDIR.<br/> • If you are using the MOVE method, files that are ready to be submitted are available in the work_dir.<br/> • If you are using the FILE method, the .met files are stored in the work_dir.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> Caution Never delete any .met files.<br/> </blockquote> *See NOTE. |
| ENABLESUBDIR  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.enable_subdir | Boolean  | Yes  | Yes  | Values:<br/> • Yes: The entire scan_dir sub-directory tree is monitored.<br/> • No: No scan is performed. |
| METHOD  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.method | enum  | MOVE  | MOVE  | Values:<br/> • MOVE: Files are moved (by renaming), to the work_dir prior to being submitted.<br/> • FILE: Files are left in the scan_dir, and a state file with the same name is created in work_dir prior to submitting the file. |
| FILEIDLEDELAY  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_idle_delay | integer  | 5  | 5  | If the state of a file has not changed within this delay in seconds, the file becomes a candidate for submission.  |
| IDF  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.idf | string  | &quot;&quot;  | &quot;&quot;  | The IDF name to use in the SEND command. Use one of the following:<br/> • A fixed name.<br/> • &quot;(0)&quot;: The name of the first directory sub-level is used.<br/> • &quot;(1)&quot;: The name of the second directory sub-level is used. |
| PART  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.part | string  | &quot;&quot;  | &quot;&quot;  | The PART name to use in the SEND command. Use one of the following:<br/> • A fixed name.<br/> • &quot;(0)&quot;: The name of the first directory sub-level is used.<br/> • &quot;(1)&quot;: The name of the second directory sub-level is used. |
| INTERVAL  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.interval | int  | 60  | 60  | The interval between two scans of the directory files in seconds.  |
| FILECOUNT  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_count | int  | -1  | 0  | Maximum number of file submissions for each scan. Using the default value indicates that there is no maximum. |
| FILESIZEMIN  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_size_min | int  | -1  | 0  | Files shorter than this value, in bytes, are not candidates for submission. Using the default value indicates that there is no lower limit on the file size. |
| FILESIZEMAX  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_size_max | int  | -1  | 0  | Files larger than this value, in bytes, are not candidates for submission. Using the default value indicates that there is no upper limit on the file size.  |
| INCLUDEFILTER  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_include_filter | string  | &quot;&quot;  | &quot;&quot;  | If this parameter is defined, only files whose names match this pattern are monitored.  |
| EXCLUDEFILTER  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.file_exclude_filter | string  | &quot;&quot;  | &quot;&quot;  | If this parameter is defined, files whose names match this pattern are not monitored.  |
| RESUBMITCHANGED  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.resubmit_changed_file | Boolean  | Yes  | Yes  | This parameter has no effect when the configured method is MOVE.<br/> When the method parameter value is set to FILE:<br/> • Yes: When the state of a previously submitted file is seen as having changed, the file is submitted again.<br/> • No: Files are not resubmitted, regardless of changes.<br/> <blockquote> **Note**<br/> Note: The file is resubmitted after any change regardless of if the modification is a small change, or purging and replacing the file with another file having the same name.<br/> </blockquote>  |
| FILTERTYPE  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.filter_type | enum  | WILDMAT  | WILDMAT  | Defines the pattern matching algorithm to use for file name filtering. Values:<br/> • STRJCMP: The Transfer CFT pattern matching algorithm.<br/> • WILDMAT: A well known public domain algorithm, and is the default. **Unix/Windows only**<br/> See [Create inclusion and exclusion filters](#Defining) for details. |
| RENAMEMETHOD  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.renaming_method | Enum  | TIMESTAMP  | TIMESTAMP  | This parameter applies only to the MOVE method.<br/> • NONE or &quot; &quot;: The filename is unchanged (no timestamp is added). If the file already exists in the work directory, the MOVE process fails.<br/> • TIMESTAMP, a timestamp of the pattern YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is added at the end of the name of the renamed file but before the last '.'.<br/> For example, using timestamp_separators=&quot;.&quot;: • myfile is renamed myfile.20131025<br/> • myfile.txt is renamed myfile.20131025.txt |
| RENAMESEPARATOR  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.renaming_separators | string  |   |   | This parameter only applies to the MOVE method. It must contain at most 2 characters from among the following:<br/> .[]()i_-<br/> The first character defines the separator before the timestamp. The second one, when present, defines the separator after the timestamp.<br/> For example, using timestamp_separators &quot;[]&quot;: - myfile is renamed myfile.[20131025] - myfile.txt is renamed myfile.[20131025].txt |
| N/A in this version  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.control | string  |   |   | Metadata used to control user changes.  |
| USEFSEVENTS<br/>  | folder_monitoring.folders.<br/> &lt;logical_name&gt;.<br/> use_file_system_events<br/> [More information](../folder_monitor_uconf#File-sys) | Boolean  | No  | No  | Set to YES to enable the file system events monitoring service to detect newly available files.  |
| USERID  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | This feature is not available in UCONF folder monitoring.  |
