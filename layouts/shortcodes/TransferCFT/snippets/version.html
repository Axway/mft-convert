Transfer CFT supports:

- TLS version 1.2, 1.1, 1.0 (TLSV1 &#124; TLSV1COMP keyword)
- SSL version 3.0 (SSLV3 &#124; SSLV3COMP keyword)

**About sessions**

In Transfer CFT, the SSL/TLS session version is proposed by the client and negotiated with the server.

**Client mode**

DIRECT=CLIENT

In client mode, TLSV1COMP or SSLV3COMP sets the header length in the NSDU to enable compatibility with other products.

**Server mode**

DIRECT=SERVER

In server mode, the header length is automatically detected for all SSL versions (SSLV3, TLSV1, SSLV3COMP, TLSV1COMP).
